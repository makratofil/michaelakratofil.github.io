	abstract = {Studies have shown that pelagic predators do not overlap with their prey at small scales. However, we hypothesized that spinner dolphin foraging would be affected by the spatio-temporal dynamics of their prey at both small and large scales. A modified echosounder was used to simultaneously measure the abundance of dolphins and their prey as a function of space and time off three Hawaiian islands. Spinner dolphin abundance closely matched the abundance patterns in the boundary community both horizontally and vertically. As hypothesized, spinner dolphins followed the diel horizontal migration of their prey, rather than feeding offshore the entire night. Spinner dolphins also followed the vertical migrations of their prey and exploited the vertical areas within the boundary layer that had the highest prey density. Cooperative foraging by pairs of dolphins within large groups was evident. The geometric and density characteristics of prey patches containing dolphins indicate that dolphins may alter the characteristics of prey patches through this cooperative foraging. The overlap of Hawaiian spinner dolphins and their prey at many temporal and spatial scales, ranging from several minutes to an entire night and 20 m to several kilometers, indicates that the availability of truly synoptic data may fundamentally alter our conclusions about pelagic predator-prey interactions.},

	abstract = {The pattern of prey distribution can profoundly affect the foraging behavior and success of a predator. In pelagic marine ecosystems, where prey is often patchily distributed, predators must be able to adapt quickly to changes in the spatial patterning of prey. Antarctic fur seals feed primarily on krill, which is patchily distributed. When combined with information about swimming speed on the surface, the time taken for a fur seal to locate a new patch after leaving an old one is an indication of the distance between patches. The frequency distribution of intervals between bouts of foraging showed that fur seals foraged at two spatial distributions: (I) a fine-scale (median distance 0.18-0.27 km) represented by short ({\textless}5 min) travel durations between patches; and (2) a coarser or mesoscale (median distance 1.3-1.6 km) represented by longer ({\textgreater}5 min) travel durations. In a study lasting 5 yr, the distributions of travel durations between bouts of feeding changed between years. These changes suggested that the structure and/or the spatial distribution of krill swarms varied between years. The behavior of fur seals suggested that there was overall clumping of prey at the fine-scale, but there was a more even spacing of prey patches at the meso-scale level. Only in I yr of the study (I 990/1991) were there indications that fur seals had difficulty in finding enough food. Fur seal behavior suggested that there was no reduction in the number of prey patches available in that year but that prey patches were of poorer quality. The study showed how predator behavior can provide valuable information about the functional relationship between prey dispersion and predator performance.},

	abstract = {Seabirds are considered to rely on prey that are patchily distributed and whose abundance differs greatly according to physical processes or water masses. However, very little information is available about the environmental factors and individual factors that affect the foraging success of marine predators. We studied the distribution of prey encounters, foraging success, and efﬁciency in different water masses and during two stages of the breeding season when energy requirements differed in Wandering Albatrosses (Diomedea exulans) of known experience and sex. The birds were simultaneously ﬁtted with satellite transmitters, stomach temperature sensors, and activity recorders. Only 27\% of prey were captured in patches (distance between two prey , 1 km); the rest were caught at an average distance of 64 km. Prey in patches were smaller than isolated prey and were caught mainly at night. Diet analysis indicated that albatrosses preyed mainly upon adult squid: squid taken at night were smaller (bioluminescent species), whereas those taken during the day were larger (nonbioluminescent species). Birds spent more time foraging farther from the colony during incubation than during brooding, when their energy requirement was highest, but foraging effort (landings per hour, or kilometers per hour), foraging success (grams of prey per hour), and efﬁciency (grams of prey per landing per hour) were similar during the two stages. The rate of prey encounter and foraging efﬁciency did not differ between water masses or between oceanic and shelf-slope waters. We found no differences between the sexes in terms of foraging success and efﬁciency. Young, inexperienced individuals had foraging success and efﬁciency similar to those of older, experienced birds but had a different strategy: they foraged more actively and caught more prey at night than did experienced birds. These results suggest strongly that Wandering Albatrosses rely on prey that are highly dispersed, catch few prey within the same patch, and do not adjust foraging effort according to energy requirements. The unpredictability of the location of prey and the type of prey caught by Wandering Albatrosses indicate that the species has a unique foraging strategy compared to most seabirds, which generally concentrate in more predictable foraging areas.},

	abstract = {Some marine species have been shown to target foraging at particular hotspots of high prey abundance. However, we show here that in the year after a nesting season, female leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the Atlantic generally spend relatively little time in ﬁxed hotspots, especially those with a surface signature revealed in satellite imagery, but rather tend to have a pattern of near continuous traveling. Associated with this traveling, distinct changes in dive behavior indicate that turtles constantly ﬁne tune their foraging behavior and diel activity patterns in association with local conditions. Switches between nocturnal vs. diurnal activity are rare in the animal kingdom but may be essential for survival on a diet of gelatinous zooplankton where patches of high prey availability are rare. These results indicate that in their ﬁrst year after nesting, leatherback turtles do not ﬁt the general model of migration where responses to resources are suppressed during transit. However, their behavior may be different in their sabbatical years away from nesting beaches. Our results highlight the importance of whole-ocean ﬁshing gear regulations to minimize turtle bycatch.

	abstract = {Many established models of animal foraging assume that individuals are ecologically equivalent. However, it is increasingly recognized that populations may comprise individuals who differ consistently in their diets and foraging behaviors. For example, recent studies have shown that individual foraging site ﬁdelity (IFSF, when individuals consistently forage in only a small part of their population’s home range) occurs in some colonial breeders. Short-term IFSF could result from animals using a win–stay, lose–shift foraging strategy. Alternatively, it may be a consequence of individual specialization. Pelagic seabirds are colonial central-place foragers, classically assumed to use ﬂexible foraging strategies to target widely dispersed, spatiotemporally patchy prey. However, tracking has shown that IFSF occurs in many seabirds, although it is not known whether this persists across years. To test for long-term IFSF and to examine alternative hypotheses concerning its cause, we repeatedly tracked 55 Northern Gannets (Morus bassanus) from a large colony in the North Sea within and across three successive breeding seasons. Gannets foraged in neritic waters, predictably structured by tidal mixing and thermal stratiﬁcation, but subject to stochastic, wind-induced overturning. Both within and across years, coarse to mesoscale (tens of kilometers) IFSF was signiﬁcant but not absolute, and foraging birds departed the colony in individually consistent directions. Carbon stable isotope ratios in gannet blood tissues were repeatable within years and nitrogen ratios were also repeatable across years, suggesting long-term individual dietary specialization. Individuals were also consistent across years in habitat use with respect to relative sea surface temperature and in some dive metrics, yet none of these factors accounted for IFSF. Moreover, at the scale of weeks, IFSF did not decay over time and the magnitude of IFSF across years was similar to that within years, suggesting that IFSF is not primarily the result of win–stay, lose–shift foraging. Rather, we hypothesize that site familiarity, accrued early in life, causes IFSF by canalizing subsequent foraging decisions. Evidence from this and other studies suggests that IFSF may be common in colonial central-place foragers, with farreaching consequences for our attempts to understand and conserve these animals in a rapidly changing environment.},

                  Group‐hunting animals have been shown to engage their prey in long pursuits (kms) to increase capture success, but the evidence for this is limited to a few terrestrial species. This predation strategy may be effective in the open‐ocean, where group‐hunts are characterised by large predator–prey size ratios and there are few places for prey to hide.
                
                
                  However, recording the attack rates, capture rates and capture success probabilities of grouping predators during long‐distance pursuits through the open ocean, remains a significant challenge.
                
                
                  
                    Here we use a combination of underwater and aerial video to assess the attack and capture behaviour of striped marlin,
                    Kajikia audax
                    , in relation to the movement of their schooling prey (‘stationary’ and ‘mobile’ movement states) during group hunts.
                  
                
                
                  We found that the attack rate was higher when the prey school was ‘stationary’ and, during these times, individual marlin could make longer sequences of uninterrupted attacks on the prey school, effectively monopolising the prey resource for short periods over conspecifics.
                
                
                  When the prey school was ‘mobile’, the attack pattern changed and individual marlin alternated their attacks on the prey school more frequently. Capture success probability (likelihood of capture per attack) was not affected by prey movement state. However, attacks on ‘mobile’ schools resulted in more prey fish becoming isolated from the school, and these isolated prey were easily captured—not by the attacker but by conspecifics swimming nearby.
                
                
                  
                    The likelihood of a prey becoming isolated from a ‘mobile’ school was predicted by prey school speed, with a 0.1 m s
                    −1
                    increase leading to an 18.01\% increase in the chance of isolation.
                  
                
                
                  Altogether this meant the capture rate at the group level was highest when the prey school was ‘mobile’ rather than ‘stationary’ because the predators that were pursuing the ‘mobile’ prey school had an increased availability of isolated and easy to capture prey.
                
                
                  This mechanism provides evidence for a by‐product mutualism selecting for conspecific group formation and we discuss our findings in consideration of the social structure of the hunting group and the type of prey.

This accords with classic optimal foraging concepts, which state that animals should maximize net energy gain by minimizing costs where possible and show how deriving energy landscapes can help understand how and why animals distribute themselves in space.},

A variety of differences exist between populations in these types of areas, including average group sizes, extent of movements, and frequency of multi-species associations. Diving and nighttime behaviour of pantropical spotted dolphins were studied near the islands of Maui and Lana′ i, Hawai′ i, in 1999. Suction-cup-attached time–depth recorder/VHF-radio tags were deployed on six dolphins for a total of 29 h. Rates of movements of tagged dolphins were substantially lower than reported in pelagic waters. Average diving depths and durations were shallower and shorter than reported for other similar-sized odontocetes but were similar to those reported in a study of pantropical spotted dolphins in the pelagic waters of the eastern tropical Pacific. Dives (defined as {\textgreater}5 m deep) at night were deeper (mean = 57.0 m, SD = 23.5 m, n = 2 individuals, maximum depth 213 m) than during the day (mean = 12.8 m, SD = 2.1 m, n = 4 individuals, maximum depth 122 m), and swim velocity also increased after dark. These results, together with the series of deep dives recorded immediately after sunset, suggest that pantropical spotted dolphins around Hawai′i feed primarily at night on organisms associated with the deep-scattering layer as it rises up to the surface after dark.},

Over 113 000 depth measurements were made over the equivalent of {\textasciitilde}200 sampling days. The mean foraging depth was 1182 m (SD = 305 m), and the mean of the maximum depth of all foraging dives was 1427 m (SD = 298 m). Mean foraging depths increased with seafloor depths up to a maximum of {\textasciitilde}1300 m at a seafloor depth of 1900 m, but decreased slightly to a mean of {\textasciitilde}1200 m at seafloor depths of 2000−4000 m. Near-bottom habitat appears to be important for foraging; whales spent {\textasciitilde}30\% of their foraging time within 200 m of the bottom at seafloor depths of 1000−2000 m. However, little foraging time was spent near the bottom at seafloor depths greater than 2000 m. The percentage of time spent at near-surface depths ({\textless} 50 m) was more than twice as high at night (25\%) than during the day (12\%). Lunar light also appears to affect diving, with 28\% of dark nights and only 17\% of brightly moonlit nights spent at these near-surface depths. The apparent avoidance of surface waters during daytime and on brightly moonlit nights is consistent with avoidance of visual predators. A considerably greater fraction of time was spent foraging at night (24.8\%) than during the day (15.7\%), possibly due to energetic constraints imposed by predator avoidance during the day.},

	abstract = {Marine prey often occur in hierarchical mosaics whereby small, high-density patches are nested inside of larger, lower density aggregations. We tested the extent to which the foraging behavior of a marine predator (northern fur seal Callorhinus ursinus) could be explained by the hierarchical patch structure of a dominant prey species (juvenile walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma) in the eastern Bering Sea. Comparing the movements of satellite-tracked fur seals with ship-based acoustic surveys of prey revealed that fur seals did not randomly search for prey, but instead showed deviations in the distribution of step-lengths (distances between their foraging patches) corresponding to the distances between aggregations of prey. Scales of prey distribution varied between Bering Sea shelf and deep-water slope habitats, while spatial scale distributions of fur seals showed corresponding changes, indicating that their search strategies were not innate patterns decoupled from the environment. Fur seals tended to avoid the smallest prey patches in both shelf and slope habitats. They also avoided prey patches that were separated by large distances. Fur seals responded to several levels of prey patchiness simultaneously, resulting in strong correlations between predator and prey over the entire range of aggregation scales observed in juvenile pollock. Our results indicate that, despite having a varied diet, fur seal foraging paths were defined by juvenile pollock aggregations. The presence of hierarchical, scale-dependent aggregation in both predator and prey provides new insights into fur seal behavior and a means to predict the dynamics of their interactions with prey.},

                  Diel cycles in marine predator diving behaviour centre around the light‐mediated diel vertical migration (DVM) of prey, and are considered critical for optimizing foraging and limiting competition across global seascapes. Yet, our understanding of predator diel behaviour is based primarily on examining relative depth usage between constant day/night cycles with no formal investigation of how varying light regimes interact with abiotic factors to shape diel activity.
                
                
                  The extreme seasonal light regimes (midnight sun, polar night, day/night cycle) in the Arctic provide a unique natural experimental setting to empirically investigate the occurrence and intensity of diel behaviour in marine predators relative to changing light levels while concomitantly assessing interacting abiotic factors.
                
                
                  
                    Depth time series data from satellite‐linked tags deployed on six beluga whales
                    (Delphinapterus leucas
                    ) for up to 12 months were used to quantify diel behaviour by calculating dissimilarity in time‐at‐depth between periods of low and high solar altitude on each day. Generalized additive mixed effects models were used to examine the influence of hours of daylight across extreme light cycles, coupled with bathymetry and sea ice concentration; focal diel patterns were further examined relative to the thermal structure of the water column.
                  
                
                
                  As predicted, belugas exhibited cathemerality during the midnight sun, and initiated diel behaviour with the onset of the fall day/night cycle, with a marked increase in its intensity with the progression to equal day/night length. Occurrence of diel patterns, however, was complex; ceasing in regions with seafloor depths {\textless}700 m, and occurring with greatest intensity when the water column was thermally homogeneous within the upper 150 m.
                
                
                  Through empirical investigation, this study demonstrates that the onset of day/night light cycles and presumably associated prey DVM can modulate predator diel dive behaviour under certain circumstances, but highlights how the complex interaction of abiotic factors with light regime shape dynamic spatiotemporal patterns. These findings, building on a body of recent work, emphasize that the traditional view of the ubiquitous occurrence of diel behaviour tied to DVM at the base of the food web oversimplifies vertical predator–prey interactions, identifying the need for more structured investigation.

A hallmark of animals diving to depth is a substantial elevation of muscle myoglobin concentration. In deep divers, more than 80\% of the oxygen store is in the blood and muscles. How these oxygen stores are managed, particularly within muscle, is unclear. The aerobic endurance of four species has now been measured. These measurements provide a standard for other species in which the limits cannot be measured. Diving to depth requires several adaptations to the effects of pressure. In mammals, one adaptation is lung collapse at shallow depths, which limits absorption of nitrogen. Blood N2 levels remain below the threshold for decompression sickness. No such adaptive model is known for birds. There appear to be two diving strategies used by animals that dive to depth. Seals, for example, seldom rely on anaerobic metabolism. Birds, on the other hand, frequently rely on anaerobic metabolism to exploit prey-rich depths otherwise unavailable to them.},

	abstract = {The foraging strategies of diving marine species are often categorized into 3 fundamental groups (epipelagic, mesopelagic, and benthic foraging) based on diving, habitat use, and diet studies. Because these foraging strategies are influenced by the distribution and behavior of the prey being targeted, we would expect search behavior and space use to differ depending on the strategy employed. Since northern fur seals Callorhinus ursinus display both epipelagic and benthic foraging strategies, they were an ideal model to test the hypothesis that fine-scale movement and space-use patterns will vary when animals use markedly different foraging strategies. Dive bouts were characterized into foraging strategies based on numerous dive parameters (depth, duration, etc.). For each strategy, we compared movement patterns (e.g. transit rate and path straightness) and space use (area-restricted search [ARS] zones) around St. Paul Island, Alaska, USA. Nearly all dive parameters were significantly different between foraging strategies (epipelagic vs. benthic). In addition, epipelagic bouts were more sinuous and covered a greater total distance than benthic bouts. However, the greater distances traveled in epipelagic bouts were due to longer bout durations, as transit rates were not different between the 2 strategies. On average, {\textless} 2 ARS zones were identified per trip, and the characteristics of epipelagic and benthic ARS zones were not different. By combining dive behavior with precise at-sea locations, this study has provided a greater understanding of the finescale foraging behavior of northern fur seals. Monitoring changes in foraging behavior over time and comparing behavior among populations with differing population trajectories may provide more clues as to why northern fur seal numbers on St. Paul Island continue to decline.},

However, the influence of light level on the diving behavior and habitat use of deep-diving cetaceans is not well understood. We used data from 28 depth-transmitting satellite tags deployed on short-finned pilot whales Globicephala macrorhynchus around the main Hawaiian Islands to examine movements and diving behavior in relation to lunar cycles and oceanographic season. During a full moon, dives were deeper (48.1\%) and longer (16.7\%) than during a new moon. This change appeared to be driven primarily by an increase (25.2\%) in the depth of deep dives ({\textgreater} 200 m) completed at night and an increase in the proportion of deeper daytime and twilight dives during a full moon. Dives occurred a mean of 18.3 km farther offshore (more than twice as far from shore) during a full moon compared to a new moon. During the oceanographic season with the shortest day length (fall), dives were shallower (25.4\%) and shorter (14.2\%) than seasons with longer days (summer). This suggests that changes in light level, both solar and lunar, affect the depth of prey targeted by pilot whales, which in turn influences pilot whale diving behavior and distribution. Future research should determine how these changes influence the feeding success and energetics of pilot whales.},

They are also the species most often stranded in association with Mid-Frequency Active (MFA) sonar use, a relationship that remains poorly understood. We used satellite-linked tags to record the diving behavior and locations of eight Ziphius off the Southern California coast for periods up to three months. The effort resulted in 3732 hr of dive data with associated regional movements – the first dataset of its kind for any beaked whale – and included dives to 2992 m depth and lasting 137.5 min, both new mammalian dive records. Deep dives had a group mean depth of 1401 m (s.d. = 137.8, n = 1142) and duration of 67.4 min (s.d. = 6.9). The group mean time between deep dives was 102.3 min (s.d. = 30.8, n = 783). While the previously described stereotypic pattern of deep and shallow dives was apparent, there was considerable inter- and intra-individual variability in most parameters. There was significant diel behavioral variation, including increased time near the surface and decreased shallow diving at night. However, maximum depth and the proportion of time spent on deep dives (presumed foraging), varied little from day to night. Surprisingly, tagged whales were present within an MFA sonar training range for 38\% of days locations were received, and though comprehensive records of sonar use during tag deployments were not available, we discuss the effects frequent acoustic disturbance may have had on the observed behaviors. These data better characterize the true behavioral range of this species, and suggest caution should be exercised when drawing conclusions about behavior using short-term datasets.},

Recent studies on foraging strategies show a higher complexity than previously thought due to intraspecific variability. To reliably identify foraging strategies and describe the different foraging niches they allow individual animals to realize, high-resolution multivariate approaches which consider individual variation are required. Here we dive into the foraging strategies of Galápagos sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), a tropical predator confronted with substantial annual variation in sea surface temperature. This affects prey abundance, and El Niño events, expected to become more frequent and severe with climate change, are known to have dramatic effects on sea lions. This study used high-resolution measures of depth, GPS position and acceleration collected from 39 lactating sea lion females to analyze their foraging strategies at an unprecedented level of detail using a novel combination of automated broken stick algorithm, hierarchical cluster analysis and individually fitted multivariate hidden Markov models. We found three distinct foraging strategies (pelagic, benthic, and night divers), which differed in their horizontal, vertical and temporal distribution, most likely corresponding to different prey species, and allowed us to formulate hypotheses with regard to adaptive values under different environmental scenarios. We demonstrate the advantages of our multivariate approach and inclusion of individual variation to reliably gain a deeper understanding of the adaptive value and ecological relevance of foraging strategies of marine predators in dynamic environments.},

Overall, tagged roughtoothed dolphins primarily used near-surface waters, spending between 83.6\% and 93.7\% of their time in the top 30 m of the water column. When diving, grand mean, median, and maximum dive depths were 76.9 m, 67.5 m, and 399.5 m, although individuals were in water with depths from approximately 700–1,450 m. Dive rates varied by time of day, being lowest during the day and at dawn and highest at dusk and night. Dives were deepest (M = 133.7 m, SD = 52.6 m, median = 106.5 m) and longest (M = 4.0 min, SD = 0.4 min, median = 4.0 min) at dusk, suggesting dolphins were taking advantage of prey rising to the surface in response to reduced light levels. Lunar phase indirectly affected diving, with deeper and longer dives occurring with increasing illumination.

	abstract = {Long-finned pilot whales (
              Globicephala melas
              ) are highly social cetaceans that live in matrilineal groups and acquire their prey during deep foraging dives. We tagged individual pilot whales to record their diving behaviour. To describe the social context of this individual behaviour, the tag data were matched with surface observations at the group level using a novel protocol. The protocol comprised two key components: a dynamic definition of the group centred around the tagged individual, and a set of behavioural parameters quantifying visually observable characteristics of the group. Our results revealed that the diving behaviour of tagged individuals was associated with distinct group-level behaviour at the water’s surface. During foraging, groups broke up into smaller and more widely spaced units with a higher degree of milling behaviour. These data formed the basis for a classification model, using random forest decision trees, which accurately distinguished between bouts of shallow diving and bouts of deep foraging dives based on group behaviour observed at the surface. The results also indicated that members of a group to a large degree synchronised the timing of their foraging periods. This was confirmed by pairs of tagged individuals that nearly always synchronized their diving bouts. Hence, our study illustrates that integration of individual-level and group-level observations can shed new light on the social context of the individual foraging behaviour of animals living in groups.},

Moreover, the ability to access meso- and bathypelagic habitats has evolved independently across marine mammals, reptiles, birds, teleost fishes, and elasmobranchs. Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests a number of plausible functional hypotheses for deep-diving behavior. Developing ways to test among these hypotheses will, however, require new ways to quantify animal behavior and biophysical oceanographic processes at coherent spatiotemporal scales. Current knowledge gaps include quantifying ecological links between surface waters and mesopelagic habitats and the value of ecosystem services provided by biomass in the ocean twilight zone. Growing pressure for ocean twilight zone fisheries creates an urgent need to understand the importance of the deep pelagic ocean to large marine predators.},

	abstract = {False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) depredate bait and catch in the Hawai‘i-based deepset longline ﬁshery, and as a result, this species is hooked or entangled more than any other cetacean in this ﬁshery. We analyzed data collected by ﬁsheries observers and from satellite-linked transmitters deployed on false killer whales to identify patterns of odontocete depredation that could help ﬁshermen avoid overlap with whales. Odontocete depredation was observed on ˜6\% of deep-set hauls across the ﬂeet from 2004 to 2018. Model outcomes from binomial GAMMs suggested coarse patterns, for example, higher rates of depredation in winter, at lower latitudes, and with higher ﬁshing effort. However, explanatory power was low, and no covariates were identiﬁed that could be used in a predictive context. The best indicator of depredation was the occurrence of depredation on a previous set of the same vessel. We identiﬁed spatiotemporal scales of this repeat depredation to provide guidance to ﬁshermen on how far to move or how long to wait to reduce the probability of repeated interactions. The risk of depredation decreased with both space and time from a previous occurrence, with the greatest beneﬁts achieved by moving ˜400 km or waiting ˜9 d, which reduced the occurrence of depredation from 18\% to 9\% (a 50\% reduction). Fishermen moved a median 46 km and waited 4.7 h following an observed depredation interaction, which our analysis suggests is unlikely to lead to large reductions in risk. Satellite-tagged pelagic false killer whales moved up to 75 km in 4 h and 335 km in 24 h, suggesting that they can likely keep pace with longline vessels for at least four hours and likely longer. We recommend ﬁshermen avoid areas of known depredation or bycatch by moving as far and as quickly as practical, especially within a day or two of the depredation or bycatch event. We also encourage captains to communicate depredation and bycatch occurrence to enable other vessels to similarly avoid high-risk areas.},

In this paper, data from 31 pop-up satellite archival tags attached to swordﬁsh from (i) the eastern Paciﬁc, (ii) central Paciﬁc, and (iii) western North Atlantic-Caribbean were analyzed. Common across locations was a pronounced diel vertical pattern with daytime hours spent primarily below the thermocline and nighttime hours spent in warmer waters, close to the surface. One exception to this pattern was periodic daytime basking events which were most common in cooler waters off California. Maximum daytime depths were signiﬁcantly correlated with light penetration as measured by the diffuse attenuation coefﬁcient at 490 nm. Temperature did not appear to inﬂuence daytime depths, and swordﬁsh tolerated both extremely low temperatures (4°C) and rapid and dramatic temperature changes ({\textgreater}20°C). Temperature did appear to inﬂuence the nighttime depths in the Paciﬁc where ﬁsh typically remained in the surface mixed layer. In contrast, in the warm tropical Atlantic this was not the case, and nighttime depths were much deeper. In all areas, nighttime depth increased around the full moon. Given the parallels between the vertical movement patterns of swordﬁsh and those of the deep sound scattering layer we suggest that swordﬁsh vertical distribution patterns, especially during daytime, are inﬂuenced largely by resource availability. At night, when swordﬁsh are typically targeted by ﬁsheries, both ambient light and temperature inﬂuence movements. Understanding vertical movement patterns of swordﬁsh can help evaluate gear vulnerability, improve population assessments, and potentially reduce ﬁsheries bycatch.},

	abstract = {U.S. Paciﬁc pelagic longline ﬁsheries operating in the central North Paciﬁc have been subject to a series of regulations to reduce bycatch of protected species, including seabirds and sea turtles. Cetaceans are also occasionally caught, and the bycatch of false killer whales, Pseudorca crassidens, in the Hawaii-based deep-set longline ﬁshery currently exceeds allowable levels under the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA). In this study, we examined longline observer data collected between 1994 and 2009, with emphasis on 2003–2009, to identify patterns of cetacean bycatch and depredation in relation to area, time, vessel, habitat variables, ﬁshing gear, and set characteristics. The objectives of these analyses were to identify relationships amongst ﬁshery interaction rates and variables that could provide opportunities to reduce depredation by cetaceans, reduce the likelihood of incidentally catching a cetacean when present, or reduce the severity of injuries to cetaceans if caught. The results of this study were provided to the False Killer Whale Take Reduction Team, convened under the MMPA, as they developed a plan to reduce serious injury and mortality of false killer whales in these ﬁsheries. No correlates were identiﬁed that could markedly reduce depredation rates, but a slight (16\%) reduction in repeat depredation within a ﬁshing trip was evident when vessels moved at least 100 km following a depredation event. The most practical option for reducing bycatch of false killer whales was determined to be the use of small (14 ⁄ 0–16 ⁄ 0) circle hooks, which could result in an estimated 6\% reduction in bycatch and a greater likelihood of releasing animals with non-serious injuries. Additional research is needed to address unresolved questions relating to processes involved in depredation events and hookings or entanglements of false killer whales.},

Consequently, interactions of inshore vs. offshore ﬁsheries and connectivity to yellowﬁn elsewhere in the Paciﬁc remain important scientiﬁc management questions. Local ﬁsheries target adult tuna during the summer months, but subsequent tuna movements, presumably away from the islands after reproduction ceases, remain undocumented. From 2014 to 2016, we partnered with local ﬁshermen to catch and release nineteen yellowﬁn tuna (41–91 kg, estimated whole weight) off Kaua’i, with popup satellite archival tags programmed for 9–12-month missions. Although data collection periods did not exceed 59 days mainly because of tag hardware failures and predator interactions, short tracks revealed diverse patterns: local residency for some individuals, and rapid, long-distance ({\textgreater}800 km) dispersals in multiple directions for others. Adult yellowﬁn tuna frequenting the MHI have more complex movements than previously assumed. Despite being a nursery area, whether the assemblage is entirely produced and retained in the region is not resolved. However, attaining 1-year migration records requires tag performance that was not achieved by the deployed tags. It remains a prerequisite for greater understanding of yellowﬁn in the Main Hawaiian Islands and Central North Paciﬁc, including assessment of their spatial connectivity, impacts of climate change, and shifting ecosystems.},

Thus, knowledge of these species often lags behind their encounter rates.Aims To gain information on rarely-encountered odontocetes in Hawai‘i while simultaneously studying common ones.Methods During a long-term small-boat based study, we prioritised time spent with rarely-encountered species, collecting photos and biopsy samples, and satellite tagging. Sample sizes were augmented with photo contributions from members of the public and other researchers, and genetic samples from stranded animals and other researchers. Results from genetic and tag data analyses were interpreted in the context of social network placement and re-sighting histories.Key results Pygmy killer whales (Feresa attenuata) represented {\textless}2\% of odontocete sightings, and sighting rates varied by depth and among islands. Photo-identification shows that 318 of 443 identified individuals are linked by association in the main component of the social network. Movements among islands were limited, with individuals off O‘ahu and Hawai‘i exhibiting high site fidelity, although resident groups from each island share a common mitochondrial haplotype. Three groups involved in mass strandings in two different years were not linked to the main component of the social network, and did not share mitochondrial haplotypes with known resident groups.Conclusions The approach of prioritising rarely-encountered species for additional sampling is an effective way of learning more about poorly-known species.Implications Such an approach may be critical for filling data gaps for populations potentially at risk from human activities.},

	abstract = {We measured the horizontal and vertical movements of five adult yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares, estimated body mass 64 to 93 kg) near the main Hawaiian Islands, while simultaneously gathering data on oceanographic conditions and currents. Fish movements were recorded by means of ultrasonic depth-sensitive transmitters. Depth–temperature and depth–oxygen profiles were measured with vertical conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) casts, and the current-velocity field was surveyed using an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). Large adult yellowfin tuna spent ≃60 to 80\% of their time in or immediately below the relatively uniform-temperature surface-layer (i.e. above 100 m), a behavior pattern similar to that previously reported for juvenile yellowfin tuna, blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) tracked in the same area. In all three species, maximum swimming depths appear to be limited by water temperatures 8 C° colder than the surface-layer water temperature. Therefore, neither large body mass, nor the ability to maintain elevated swimming-muscle temperatures due to the presence of vascular counter-current heat exchangers in tunas, appears to permit greater vertical mobility or the ability to remain for extended periods below the thermocline. In those areas where the decrease in oxygen with depth is not limiting, the vertical movements of yellowfin tuna, blue marlin and striped marlin all appear to be restricted by the effects of water temperature on cardiac muscle function. Like juvenile yellowfin tuna, but unlike blue marlin and striped marlin, adult yellowfin tuna remained within 18.5 km of the coast and became associated with floating objects, including anchored fish-aggregating devices (FADs) and the tracking vessel. Like juvenile yellowfin tuna, large adult yellowfin repeatedly re-visit the same FAD, and appear able to navigate precisely between FADs that are up to 18 km apart. The median speed over ground ranged from 72 to 154 cm s−1. Neither speed nor direction was strongly influenced by currents.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale (10–300 km, weeks to months) physical variability strongly modulates the structure and dynamics of planktonic marine ecosystems via both turbulent advection and environmental impacts upon biological rates. Using structure function analysis (geostatistics), we quantify the mesoscale biological signals within global 13 year SeaWiFS (1998–2010) and 8 year MODIS/Aqua (2003–2010) chlorophyll a ocean color data (Level-3, 9 km resolution). We present geographical distributions, seasonality, and interannual variability of key geostatistical parameters: unresolved variability or noise, resolved variability, and spatial range. Resolved variability is nearly identical for both instruments, indicating that geostatistical techniques isolate a robust measure of biophysical mesoscale variability largely independent of measurement platform. In contrast, unresolved variability in MODIS/Aqua is substantially lower than in SeaWiFS, especially in oligotrophic waters where previous analysis identified a problem for the SeaWiFS instrument likely due to sensor noise characteristics. Both records exhibit a statistically significant relationship between resolved mesoscale variability and the low-pass filtered chlorophyll field horizontal gradient magnitude, consistent with physical stirring acting on large-scale gradient as an important factor supporting observed mesoscale variability. Comparable horizontal length scales for variability are found from tracer-based scaling arguments and geostatistical decorrelation. Regional variations between these length scales may reflect scale dependence of biological mechanisms that also create variability directly at the mesoscale, for example, enhanced net phytoplankton growth in coastal and frontal upwelling and convective mixing regions. Global estimates of mesoscale biophysical variability provide an improved basis for evaluating higher resolution, coupled ecosystem-ocean general circulation models, and data assimilation.},

Two deployments in 1997 on northern bottlenose whales in a submarine canyon off Nova Scotia demonstrated their exceptional diving ability, with dives approximately every 80 min to over 800 m (maximum 1453 m), and up to 70 min in duration. Sonar traces of non–tagged, diving bottlenose whales in 1996 and 1997 suggest that such deep dives are not unusual. This combined evidence leads us to hypothesize that these whales may make greater use of deep portions of the water column than any other mammal so far studied. Many of the recorded dives of the tagged animals were to, or close to, the sea floor, consistent with benthic or bathypelagic foraging. A lack of correlation between dive times and surface intervals suggests that the dives were predominately aerobic.},

Biologging devices (“tags”) can also measure aspects of the physical and biological characteristics of the animals’ environment. As marine ecosystems are less accessible than terrestrial ones and marine animals more elusive and difficult to study, data collected by tags attached to marine animals often have to be relayed via satellite. However, satellite availability is not continuous and decreases with decreasing latitude. Consequently, collection of sufficient data is even more challenging in the tropics and mid-latitudes than at the poles. To overcome this limitation and increase data throughput from biologgers, new land-based receiving stations (called Motes) that can receive, log and relay messages from devices transmitting on the Argos satellite frequency have been developed.},

The continuous-time model was placed into a state–space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by-products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.},

Twenty-six cetacean species have been documented in Hawaiʻi. Eleven odontocete species have distinct small populations resident to one or more island areas: rough-toothed dolphins, pantropical spotted dolphins, common bottlenose dolphins, spinner dolphins, short-finned pilot whales, false killer whales, pygmy killer whales, melon-headed whales, Blainville’s beaked whales, Cuvier’s beaked whales, and dwarf sperm whales. Eight species of mysticetes have been documented, although their occurrence and behavior are poorly understood, with the exception of breeding humpback whales and, more recently, common minke whales. Thirty-five BIAs were delineated or revised from the initial 2015 effort: 33 for small and resident odontocete populations and two for humpback whale reproductive areas. Hierarchical BIAs reflecting core areas of use or population-specific ranges were delineated for nine species. Reproductive watch list areas were designated for common minke whales in the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and humpback whales in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI); these areas did not meet the criteria for a BIA due to limited supporting information. All but three BIAs were in the MHI, reflecting the disparities in research effort between this region and the NWHI. Spatial extents of BIA boundaries ranged from 457 km

Nevertheless, evaluating the relative importance of predictors with concurvity (analogous to collinearity) on response variables in GAMs remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we developed an R package named gam.hp. gam.hp calculates individual R2 values for predictors, based on the concept of ‘average shared variance’, a method previously introduced for multiple regression and canonical analyses. Through these individual R2s, which add up to the overall R2, researchers can evaluate the relative importance of each predictor within GAMs. We illustrate the utility of the gam.hp package by evaluating the relative importance of emission sources and meteorological factors in explaining ozone concentration variability in air quality data from London, UK. We believe that the gam.hp package will improve the interpretation of results obtained from GAMs.},

The ability to accurately assess social group membership increases with the number of times individuals are identified, but obtaining sufficient sightings of rarely encountered species can be difficult. Three social clusters were previously identified for the endangered population of false killer whales Pseudorca crassidens around the main Hawaiian Islands, using modularity among associations within a 12 yr photographic dataset with no restrictions on the number of times seen. In this study, we used photo-identification data over a 23 yr period to reassess the number and membership of social clusters, restricted to individuals seen on at least 5 different days. We compared the robustness of clustering assignments from 6 community detection algorithms using modularity and found that the 3 highest-ranking algorithms all identified the same number (4) and membership of social clusters. Spatial use of clusters varied among the islands, with 3 of the 4 clusters encountered regularly only off 1 or 2 of the 3 main island study areas. Comparison of genetic differentiation among social clusters revealed significant differentiation in nuclear DNA. Furthermore, all individuals in 2 of the clusters possess the same mitochondrial DNA haplotype, while in the other 2 clusters, approximately 40\% of animals possess a second haplotype. This level of clustering and associated heterogeneity within the population may have implications for mark−recapture abundance estimation, as well as for mitigating exposure to anthropogenic activities, including interactions with fisheries.},

The proposals avoid having to use nonparametric testing methods for which there is no general reliable distributional theory. Moreover, component selection is carried out in one single step as opposed to many selection procedures which involve an exhaustive search of all possible models. The empirical performance of the proposed methods is compared to that of some available techniques via an extensive simulation study. The results show under which conditions one method can be preferred over another, hence providing applied researchers with some practical guidelines.

	abstract = {To learn more about the movement patterns of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), we deployed archival tags on 87 fish ranging in fork length from 50 to 154 cm. Thirteen fish were recaptured, from which 11 archival tags were returned, representing in aggregate 943 days-at-liberty. We successfully retrieved data from 10 tags, representing 474 days in aggregate. The largest fish recaptured was 44.5 kg [131 cm fork length (FL)] and the smallest 2.8 kg (52 cm). The deepest descent recorded was 817 m, the coldest temperature visited 4.7°C, and minimum oxygen level reached ∼1 mL L−1. Fish spent little time at depths where water temperatures were below 7°C and oxygen levels less than ∼2 mL L−1. Five fish were recaptured near the offshore weather buoy where they were tagged. Based on vertical movement patterns, it appeared that all stayed immediately associated with the buoy for up to 34 days. During this time they remained primarily in the uniform temperature surface layer (i.e. above 100 m). In contrast, fish not associated with a floating object showed the W-shaped vertical movement patterns during the day characteristic of bigeye tuna (i.e. descending to ∼300–500 m and then returning regularly to the surface layer). Four fish were tagged and subsequently recaptured near Cross Seamount up to 76 days later. These fish exhibited vertical movement patterns similar to, but less regular than, those of fish not associated with any structure. Bigeye tuna appear to follow the diel vertical movements of the deep sound scattering layer (SSL) organisms and thus to exploit them effectively as a prey resource. Average night-time depth was correlated with lunar illumination, a behaviour which mimics movements of the SSL.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

We tagged 8 dolphinfish with pressure-sensitive ultrasonic transmitters and actively tracked individuals continuously for up to 40 h to elucidate the vertical movement patterns and differences between FADassociated (FAD-A) and FAD-unassociated (FAD-U) fish. Four additional fish were equipped with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored for several days with receivers attached to FADs. When not associated with FADs, dolphinfish used the upper 75–100 m of the water column during the day and made descents up to 160 m during the night. In contrast, FAD-A fish generally stayed
within the upper 10 m of the water column and tended to make deeper excursions during the day rather than at night. Water temperature data from expendable bathythermographs deployed during active tracking showed that fish only descended to depths where temperatures were ≤3°C cooler than the uniform-temperature surface layer. The use of vertical behavior to determine whether a dolphinfish is associated or not with a floating object opens the possibility for new, large-scale research aimed at investigating the role of floating objects in the ecosystem inhabited by this species and at assessing the impacts of FADs on its ecology.},

We devised a method of species identification using 10 fin and body measurements obtainable from at-sea photographs, and demonstrated its ability to distinguish four species of Hawaiian “blackfish”: pygmy killer, melon-headed, short-finned pilot, and false killer whales. Measurements from photos of 382 known individuals were converted into 14 ratios and reduced using nonmetric multidimensional scaling and principal component analysis. The first three components of the PCA explained 81\% of variance among species. Ratios indicated by PCA and NMDS were tested using analysis of variance, and results identified three fin ratios that had distinct means across all four species: height/base, depth (from anterior insertion) at trailing edge apex/depth at topmost point, and width (from leading edge) at posterior point/base. Dual analysis of adults and all age classes showed near-identical sources of variance, 90\% similarity in interspecies ratio relationships, and overlapping ratio means and ranges. Results suggest similar ontogenetic growth across these four species, and confirm the efficacy of this discrimination technique for all age classes. This study established a reliable means of distinguishing these cetacean species, which will improve the efficacy of management in areas with sympatric distributions.},

	abstract = {Background: Foraging efficiency determines whether animals will be able to raise healthy broods, maintain their own condition, avoid predators and ultimately increase their fitness. Using accelerometers and GPS loggers, features of the habitat and the way animals deal with variable conditions can be translated into energetic costs of movement, which, in turn, can be translated to energy landscapes.We investigated energy landscapes in Gentoo Penguins Pygoscelis papua from two colonies at New Island, Falkland/Malvinas Islands.
Results: In our study, the marine areas used by the penguins, parameters of dive depth and the proportion of pelagic and benthic dives varied both between years and colonies. As a consequence, the energy landscapes also varied between the years, and we discuss how this was related to differences in food availability, which were also reflected in differences in carbon and nitrogen stable isotope values and isotopic niche metrics. In the second year, the energy landscape was characterized by lower foraging costs per energy gain, and breeding success was also higher in this year. Additionally, an area around three South American Fur Seal Arctocephalus australis colonies was never used.
Conclusions: These results confirm that energy landscapes vary in time and that the seabirds forage in areas of the energy landscapes that result in minimized energetic costs. Thus, our results support the view of energy landscapes and fear of predation as mechanisms underlying animal foraging behaviour. Furthermore, we show that energy landscapes are useful in linking energy gain and variable energy costs of foraging to breeding success.},

Individual differences in movement and space-use, fundamental to many personality traits (e.g. activity, boldness and exploratory behaviour) have been documented across many species and contexts, for instance personality-dependent dispersal syndromes. Yet, insights from the concurrently developing movement ecology paradigm are rarely considered and recent evidence for other personality-dependent movements and space-use lack a general unifying framework. We propose a conceptual framework for personality-dependent spatial ecology. We link expectations derived from the movement ecology paradigm with behavioural reaction-norms to offer speciﬁc predictions on the interactions between environmental factors, such as resource distribution or landscape structure, and intrinsic behavioural variation. We consider how environmental heterogeneity and individual consistency in movements that carry-over across spatial scales can lead to personality-dependent: (1) foraging search performance; (2) habitat preference; (3) home range utilization patterns; (4) social network structure and (5) emergence of assortative population structure with spatial clusters of personalities. We support our conceptual model with spatially explicit simulations of behavioural variation in space-use, demonstrating the emergence of complex population-level patterns from differences in simple individual-level behaviours. Consideration of consistent individual variation in space-use will facilitate mechanistic understanding of processes that drive social, spatial, ecological and evolutionary dynamics in heterogeneous environments.},

We studied individual specialisation in Scopoli’s shearwaters (Calonectris diomedea) from the highly dynamic Western Mediterranean, using daily prey distributions together with resource selection, site ﬁdelity and trophic-level analyses. As hypothesised, we found dietary diversiﬁcation, low foraging site ﬁdelity and almost no individual specialisation in resource selection. Crucially, shearwaters switched daily foraging tactics, selecting areas with contrasting prey of varying trophic levels. Overall, information use and plastic resource selection of individuals with reduced short-term foraging site ﬁdelity allow predators to overcome prey ﬁeld lability. Our study is an essential step towards a better understanding of individual responses to enhanced environmental stochasticity driven by global changes, and of pathways favouring population persistence.},

In the Selous Game Reserve, Tanzania, wild dog pack size ranged from three to 20 adults (3–44 including yearlings and pups). Data from 905 hunts and 404 kills showed that hunting success, prey mass and the probability of multiple kills increased with number of adults. Chase distance decreased with number of adults. None the less, the distribution of per capita food intake across adult pack size was U-shaped, with a minimum close to the modal pack size. A similar result has been used to conclude that cooperative hunting does not favour sociality in lions (Packer et al. 1990, Am. Nat., 136, 1–19), and to argue that cooperative hunting is not responsible for group living in any carnivore (Caro 1994, Cheetahs of the Serengeti Plains: Group Living in an Asocial Species). Daily per capita food intake only accounts for variation in the benefits to cooperative hunting, ignoring variation in costs. For Selous wild dogs, per capita food intake per km chased peaked close to the modal adult pack size (where per capita food intake per day was near its minimum). Thus, the energetics of cooperative hunting favour sociality in Selous wild dogs. Analyses that incorporate variation in both costs and benefits of hunting may show that cooperative hunting favours sociality in other species where its influence has previously been rejected.},

	abstract = {Resource partitioning is an important process driving habitat use and foraging strategies in sympatric species that potentially compete. Differences in foraging behavior are hypothesized to contribute to species coexistence by facilitating resource partitioning, but little is known on the multiple mechanisms for partitioning that may occur simultaneously. Studies are further limited in the marine environment, where the spatial and temporal distribution of resources is highly dynamic and subsequently difficult to quantify. We investigated potential pathways by which foraging behavior may facilitate resource partitioning in two of the largest co-occurring and closely related species on Earth, blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and humpback (Megaptera novaeangliae) whales. We integrated multiple long-term datasets (line-transect surveys, whale-watching records, net sampling, stable isotope analysis, and remote-sensing of oceanographic parameters) to compare the diet, phenology, and distribution of the two species during their foraging periods in the highly productive waters of Monterey Bay, California, USA within the California Current Ecosystem. Our long-term study reveals that blue and humpback whales likely facilitate sympatry by partitioning their foraging along three axes: trophic, temporal, and spatial. Blue whales were specialists foraging on krill, predictably targeting a seasonal peak in krill abundance, were present in the bay for an average of 4.7 months, and were spatially restricted at the continental shelf break. In contrast, humpback whales were generalists apparently feeding on a mixed diet of krill and fishes depending on relative abundances, were present in the bay for a more extended period (average of 6.6 months), and had a broader spatial distribution at the shelf break and inshore. Ultimately, competition for common resources can lead to behavioral, morphological, and physiological character displacement between sympatric species. Understanding the mechanisms for species coexistence is both fundamental to maintaining biodiverse ecosystems, and provides insight into the evolutionary drivers of morphological differences in closely related species.},

	abstract = {Group-hunting is ubiquitous across animal taxa and has received considerable attention in the context of its functions. By contrast much less is known about the mechanisms by which grouping predators hunt their prey. This is primarily due to a lack of experimental manipulation alongside logistical difﬁculties quantifying the behaviour of multiple predators at high spatiotemporal resolution as they search, select, and capture wild prey. However, the use of new remote-sensing technologies and a broadening of the focal taxa beyond apex predators provides researchers with a great opportunity to discern accurately how multiple predators hunt together and not just whether doing so provides hunters with a per capita beneﬁt. We incorporate many ideas from collective behaviour and locomotion throughout this review to make testable predictions for future researchers and pay particular attention to the role that computer simulation can play in a feedback loop with empirical data collection. Our review of the literature showed that the breadth of predator:prey size ratios among the taxa that can be considered to hunt as a group is very large ({\textless}100 to {\textgreater}102). We therefore synthesised the literature with respect to these predator:prey ratios and found that they promoted different hunting mechanisms. Additionally, these different hunting mechanisms are also related to particular stages of the hunt (search, selection, capture) and thus we structure our review in accordance with these two factors (stage of the hunt and predator:prey size ratio). We identify several novel group-hunting mechanisms which are largely untested, particularly under ﬁeld conditions, and we also highlight a range of potential study organisms that are amenable to experimental testing of these mechanisms in connection with tracking technology. We believe that a combination of new hypotheses, study systems and methodological approaches should help push the ﬁeld of group-hunting in new directions.},

Adaptive dispersal was modelled using the marginal value theorem, such that predators departed patches when the instantaneous rate of prey capture was less than the long-term rate of prey capture averaged over all patches, scaled to the movement time between patches. Adaptive dispersal tended to stabilize metapopulation dynamics in a similar manner to conventional fixed dispersal models, but the temporal dynamics of adaptive dispersal models were more unpredictable than the smooth oscillations of fixed dispersal models. Moreover, fixed and adaptive dispersal models responded differently to spatial variation in patch productivity and the degree of compartmentalization of the system. For both adaptive dispersal and fixed dispersal models, localized (‘stepping-stone’) dispersal was more strongly stabilizing than global (‘island’) dispersal. Variation among predators in the probability of dispersal in relation to local prey density had a strong stabilizing influence on both within-patch and metapopulation dynamics. These results suggest that adaptive space use strategies by predators could have important implications for the dynamics of spatially heterogeneous trophic systems.},

Progress on this front is limited partly because of the need to identify mechanisms controlling functions that are common to a wide range of ecosystem types. We propose that one general mechanism, rooted in the evolutionary ecology of all species, is adaptive foraging behavior in response to predation risk. To support our claim, we present two kinds of empirical evidence from plant-based and detritus-based food chains of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The first kind comes from experiments that explicitly trace how adaptive foraging influences ecosystem properties and functions. The second kind comes from a synthesis of studies that individually examine complementary components of particular ecosystems that together provide an integrated perspective on the link between adaptive foraging and ecosystem function. We show that the indirect effects of predators on plant diversity, plant productivity, nutrient cycling, trophic transfer efficiencies, and energy flux caused by consumer foraging shifts in response to risk are qualitatively different from effects caused by reductions in prey density due to direct predation. We argue that a perspective of ecosystem function that considers effects of consumer behavior in response to predation risk will broaden our capacity to explain the range of outcomes and contingencies in trophic control of ecosystems. This perspective also provides an operational way to integrate evolutionary and ecosystem ecology, which is an important challenge in ecology.},

High-resolution sampling, however, demonstrates that the ocean is peppered with narrow hot spots of organism activity. To determine whether these resource aggregations could provide a signiﬁcant solution to the ocean’s food paradox, a conceptual graphical model was developed that facilitates comparisons of the role of patchiness in predator-prey interactions across taxa, size scales, and ecosystems. The model predicts that predators are more reliant on aggregated resources for foraging success when the average concentrations of resources is low, the size discrepancy between predator and prey is great, the predator has a high metabolic rate, and/or the predator’s foraging time is limited. Size structure differences between marine and terrestrial food webs and a vast disparity in the overall mean density of their resources lead to the conclusion that high-density aggregations of prey are much more important to the survival of oceanic predators than their terrestrial counterparts, shaping the foraging decisions that are available to an individual and setting the stage on which evolutionary pressures can act. Patches of plenty may be rare, but they play an outsized role in behavioral, ecological, and evolutionary processes, particularly in the sea.},

Here we show that the nearshore environment off the west coast of Hawaiʻi exhibits an increased biomass and abundance of mesopelagic micronekton. Acoustic surveys from this study and prior work show a higher nautical area scattering coefficient (as a proxy for biomass) in a deep non-migratory layer in nearshore sites compared to offshore sites that is persistent over five years. Cobb trawl samples taken at the depths of the deep scattering layer ({\textasciitilde}450 to {\textasciitilde}550 m) in 2016 and 2017 showed 1.3 to 2.2 times higher biomass and 2.7 times higher abundance nearshore ({\textasciitilde}4 km from shore) compared to offshore ({\textasciitilde}24 km from shore). Fishes dominated the trawl catches and a large fraction of the nearshore enhancements were due to Sternoptychidae and Serrivomeridae across both years. In contrast, Melamphaeidae consistently were more abundant and had greater biomass offshore. This deep scattering assemblage contrasts with the mesopelagic boundary layer assemblage by being nonmigratory and taxonomically different in composition. These nearshore mesopelagic enhancements could occur as the result of increased nearshore food supplies deriving from Island Mass Effect enhanced primary production or from advection and concentration in a complex flow environment in the lee of the island. Regardless of mechanism, this temporally persistent, high biomass, largely nonmigratory layer of mesopelagic micronekton is different from the better known migratory mesopelagic boundary layer assemblage and may provide food to deeper diving marine mammals and pelagic fishes possibly explaining the aggregation of large pelagic animals in this region.},

	abstract = {Significance
            Understanding the key drivers of animal movement is crucial to assist in mitigating adverse impacts of anthropogenic activities on marine megafauna. We found that movement patterns of marine megafauna are mostly independent of their evolutionary histories, differing significantly from patterns for terrestrial animals. We detected a remarkable convergence in the distribution of speed and turning angles across organisms ranging from whales to turtles (epitome for the slowest animals on land but not at sea). Marine megafauna show a prevalence of movement patterns dominated by search behavior in coastal habitats compared with more directed, ballistic movement patterns when the animals move across the open ocean. The habitats through which they move will therefore need to be considered for effective conservation.
          , 
            The extent of increasing anthropogenic impacts on large marine vertebrates partly depends on the animals’ movement patterns. Effective conservation requires identification of the key drivers of movement including intrinsic properties and extrinsic constraints associated with the dynamic nature of the environments the animals inhabit. However, the relative importance of intrinsic versus extrinsic factors remains elusive. We analyze a global dataset of ∼2.8 million locations from {\textgreater}2,600 tracked individuals across 50 marine vertebrates evolutionarily separated by millions of years and using different locomotion modes (fly, swim, walk/paddle). Strikingly, movement patterns show a remarkable convergence, being strongly conserved across species and independent of body length and mass, despite these traits ranging over 10 orders of magnitude among the species studied. This represents a fundamental difference between marine and terrestrial vertebrates not previously identified, likely linked to the reduced costs of locomotion in water. Movement patterns were primarily explained by the interaction between species-specific traits and the habitat(s) they move through, resulting in complex movement patterns when moving close to coasts compared with more predictable patterns when moving in open oceans. This distinct difference may be associated with greater complexity within coastal microhabitats, highlighting a critical role of preferred habitat in shaping marine vertebrate global movements. Efforts to develop understanding of the characteristics of vertebrate movement should consider the habitat(s) through which they move to identify how movement patterns will alter with forecasted severe ocean changes, such as reduced Arctic sea ice cover, sea level rise, and declining oxygen content.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals feed at a variety of trophic levels, occur from freshwater to open-ocean ecosystems and are found across virtually all latitudes. Due to their high historical, and sometimes present-day, abundances, capability for large-scale movements and high metabolic rates, they have the potential to affect the structure and function of ecosystems through a variety of mechanisms over both ecological and evolutionary time. Usually, the effects of marine mammals on ecosystems are explicitly or implicitly considered to occur through their ability to remove prey through direct predation. Recent empirical studies and a rich theoretical framework, however, demonstrate that marine mammals can affect ecosystems through more diverse pathways, including those that are driven by marine mammal behaviour. Thus, non-consumptive effects of and on marine mammals may be critical in shaping their ecological importance. Non-consumptive effects may include risk effects, whereby predators induce costly changes to prey behaviour that impact prey population sizes or the magnitude and spatiotemporal patterns of prey impacts on communities (e.g. behaviour-mediated trophic cascades). Changes in the abundance of large apex predators (both marine mammals and sharks) and the introduction of perceived and real risks (human disturbance) may also affect behaviours of marine mammals and their prey that cascade to the wider ecosystem; the conditions under which such cascading effects might be most important, however, remain poorly understood. Other behaviour-driven ecological roles of marine mammals may include foraging tactics that facilitate the foraging of other species (especially seabirds), translocating nutrients and linking the dynamics of spatially distinct food webs.},

For many herbivorous and omnivorous mesozooplankton that feed predominantly near the surface on phytoplankton and microzooplankton, minimising the risk of predation from fish seems to be the ultimate factor behind DVM. These migrants appear to use deep water as a dark daytime refuge where their probability of being detected and eaten is lower than if they remained near the surface. Associated with these vertical movements of mesozooplankton, predators at higher trophic levels, including invertebrates, fish, marine mammals, birds and reptiles, may modify their behaviour to optimise the exploitation of their vertically migrating prey. Recent advances in biotelemetry promise to allow the interaction between migrating zooplankton and diving air-breathing vertebrates to be explored in far more detail than hitherto.},

Migration patterns were measured over six complete lunar cycles using moored upward-looking echosounders while nocturnal surface irradiance was recorded. We hypothesized that animals would remain at a constant isolume at night despite changes in nocturnal illumination between nights. The scattering layer migrated closer to the surface during dark nights than during well-lit ones. However, this movement was not enough to compensate for observed changes in light, and at night animals often remained at light levels higher than they experience at depth during the day. Light and lunar cycle were not completely coupled, allowing separation of the light and lunar phases. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, lunar phase accounted for substantially more of the variability in layer migration than surface irradiance, showing strong effects on the scattering layer’s depth and animal density within the layer. Changes in layer depth and animal density were amplified a small amount by variations in light level but were minimized by the seafloor in shallow areas. The horizontal component of the scattering layer’s migration was also affected by lunar phase, with animals remaining further offshore in deeper waters during nights near and during the full moon, even when these were not the nights with the highest light levels. These results suggest that moonlight may be a cue for an endogenous lunar rhythm in the process of diel migration rather than a direct cause.},

            Phytoplankton production drives marine ecosystem trophic-structure and global fisheries yields. Phytoplankton biomass is particularly influential near coral reef islands and atolls that span the oligotrophic tropical oceans. The paradoxical enhancement in phytoplankton near an island-reef ecosystem—Island Mass Effect (IME)—was first documented 60 years ago, yet much remains unknown about the prevalence and drivers of this ecologically important phenomenon. Here we provide the first basin-scale investigation of IME. We show that IME is a near-ubiquitous feature among a majority (91\%) of coral reef ecosystems surveyed, creating near-island ‘hotspots’ of phytoplankton biomass throughout the upper water column. Variations in IME strength are governed by geomorphic type (atoll vs island), bathymetric slope, reef area and local human impacts (for example, human-derived nutrient input). These ocean oases increase nearshore phytoplankton biomass by up to 86\% over oceanic conditions, providing basal energetic resources to higher trophic levels that support subsistence-based human populations.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding how marine predators find patchily distributed prey resources in a dynamic environment is key to identifying important ecological areas for ecosystem-level conservation management. However, the mechanisms underpinning important foraging areas often result from complex interactions between static and dynamic covariates (e.g. topography and currents). Modelling habitat associations with hydrodynamic processes is rarely useful when attempting to identify and characterise foraging areas across an individual’s foraging range. Investigating the influence of static habitat features on predator behaviour can provide a more tractable baseline understanding of habitat associations, upon which additional complexity can be added. Seabed gradient covariates (e.g. slope and aspect) are often used, yet such metrics are computed at singular user-defined resolutions, and provide limited ecological insight when used in isolation. Instead, categorising the seabed into geomorphological features may provide better characterisation of seabed structure. Here we explore the utility of a pattern recognition algorithm to delineate whole geomorphological features (“geomorphons”) on the seabed (e.g. valleys, ridges, footslopes) from bathymetry data, and examine the influence of geomorphology on marine predator habitat use. We demonstrate the potential application of this approach in a case study, examining the influence of geomorphons on the at-sea behaviour of a highly mobile predator inhabiting shelf seas: the grey seal ({\textless}italic{\textgreater}Halichoerus grypus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater}). We analyse GPS tracking data from three seals tagged in the southern North Sea, an area with heterogeneous geomorphology. We use hidden Markov models (HMMs) to infer foraging and travelling behaviour and model the effect of different feature types on the probability of switching between states. All three seals showed an increased probability of transitioning from travelling to foraging when encountering slopes, footslopes and hollows, and foraging activity was concentrated at slopes on the fringes of the Dogger Bank. We hypothesise that such features may host prey aggregations, and/or lead to increased prey capture success. The results suggest the importance of such areas for grey seals in the southern North Sea, a region undergoing rapid and widespread anthropogenic habitat change. This method could be incorporated into future species distribution models to improve estimates of predator distribution, informing conservation management and marine spatial planning.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Mid-latitude (∼30-60°) seasonally stratifying shelf-seas support a high abundance and diversity of marine predators such as marine mammals and seabirds. However, anthropogenic activities and climate change impacts are driving changes in the distributions and population dynamics of these animals, with negative consequences for ecosystem functioning. Across mid-latitude shelf-seas marine mammals and seabirds are known to forage across a number of oceanographic habitats that structure the spatio-temporal distributions of prey fields. Knowledge of these and the bio-physical mechanisms driving such associations are needed to improve marine management and policy. Here, we provide a concise and easily accessible guide for both researchers and managers of marine systems on the predominant oceanographic habitats that are favoured for foraging by marine mammals and seabirds across mid-latitude shelf-seas. We (1) identify and describe key discrete physical features present across the continental shelf, working inshore from the shelf-edge to the shore line, (2) provide an overview of findings relating to associations between these habitats and marine mammals and seabirds, (3) identify areas for future research and (4) discuss the relevance of such information to conservation management. We show that oceanographic features preferentially foraged at by marine mammals and seabirds include shelf-edge fronts, upwelling and tidal-mixing fronts, offshore banks and internal waves, regions of stratification, and topographically complex coastal areas subject to strong tidal flow. Whilst associations were variable across taxa and through space and time, in the majority of cases interactions between bathymetry and tidal currents appear to play a dominant role, alongside patterns in seasonal stratification and shelf-edge upwelling. We suggest that the ecological significance of these bio-physical structures stems from a capacity to alter the densities, distributions (both horizontally and vertically) and/or behaviours of prey in a persistent and/or predictable manner that increases accessibility for predators, and likely enhances foraging efficiency. Future conservation management should aim to preserve and protect these habitats. This will require adaptive and holistic strategies that are specifically tailored to the characteristics of an oceanographic feature, and where necessary, evolve through space and time in response to spatio-temporal variability. Improved monitoring of animal movements and bio-physical conditions across shelf-seas would aid in this. Areas for future research include multi-disciplinary/trophic studies of the mechanisms linking bio-physical processes, prey and marine mammals and seabirds (which may elucidate the importance of lesser studied features such as bottom fronts and Langmuir circulation cells), alongside a better understanding of how predators perceive their environment and develop foraging strategies during immature/juvenile stages. Estimates of the importance of oceanographic habitat features at a population level should also be obtained. Such information is vital to ensuring the future health of these complex ecosystems, and can be used to assess how anthropogenic activities and future environmental changes will impact the functioning and spatio-temporal dynamics of these bio-physical features and their use by marine predators.},

	abstract = {Marine predators face the challenge of reliably finding prey that is patchily distributed in space and time. Predators make movement decisions at multiple spatial and temporal scales, yet we have a limited understanding of how habitat selection at multiple scales translates into foraging performance. In the ocean, there is mounting evidence that submesoscale (i.e. less than 100 km) processes drive the formation of dense prey patches that should hypothetically provide feeding hot spots and increase predator foraging success. Here, we integrated environmental remote-sensing with high-resolution animal-borne biologging data to evaluate submesoscale surface current features in relation to the habitat selection and foraging performance of blue whales in the California Current System. Our study revealed a consistent functional relationship in which blue whales disproportionately foraged within dynamic aggregative submesoscale features at both the regional and feeding site scales across seasons, regions and years. Moreover, we found that blue whale feeding rates increased in areas with stronger aggregative features, suggesting that these features indicate areas of higher prey density. The use of fine-scale, dynamic features by foraging blue whales underscores the need to take these features into account when designating critical habitat and may help inform strategies to mitigate the impacts of human activities for the species.},

	abstract = {How animal movement decisions interact with the distribution of resources to shape individual performance is a key question in ecology. However, links between spatial and behavioural ecology and fitness consequences are poorly understood because the outcomes of individual resource selection decisions, such as energy intake, are rarely measured. In the open ocean, mesoscale features (approx. 10–100 km) such as fronts and eddies can aggregate prey and thereby drive the distribution of foraging vertebrates through bottom-up biophysical coupling. These productive features are known to attract predators, yet their role in facilitating energy transfer to top-level consumers is opaque. We investigated the use of mesoscale features by migrating northern elephant seals and quantified the corresponding energetic gains from the seals' foraging patterns at a daily resolution. Migrating elephant seals modified their diving behaviour and selected for mesoscale features when foraging. Daily energy gain increased significantly with increasing mesoscale activity, indicating that the physical environment can influence predator fitness at fine temporal scales. Results show that areas of high mesoscale activity not only attract top predators as foraging hotspots, but also lead to increased energy transfer across trophic levels. Our study provides evidence that the physical environment is an important factor in controlling energy flow to top predators by setting the stage for variation in resource availability. Such understanding is critical for assessing how changes in the environment and resource distribution will affect individual fitness and food web dynamics.},

Occurrence and behaviour varied seasonally and among pods; some pods foraged almost entirely in open water and were recorded in the study area throughout the year, while others spent much of their time foraging around pinniped haulouts and other nearshore sites, and used the study area primarily during the harbour seal (Phoca vitulina) weaning–postweaning period. Overall use of the area was greatest during that period, and energy intake at that time was significantly greater than at other times of the year, probably because of the high encounter rates and ease of capture of harbour seal pups. Multipod groups of transients were frequently observed, as has been reported for "residents," but associations were biased towards those between pods that exhibited similar foraging tactics. Despite the occurrence of transients and residents within several kilometres of each other on nine occasions, mixed groups were never observed and transients appeared to avoid residents. Combined with previous studies on behavioural, ecological, and morphological differences, such avoidance behaviour supports the supposition that these populations are reproductively isolated.},

Although the possible top-down effects of killer whale predation on populations of their prey have received much recent attention, little is known of how the abundance of these predators may be limited by bottom-up processes. Here we show, using 25 years of demographic data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, that population trends are driven largely by changes in survival, and that survival rates are strongly correlated with the availability of their principal prey species, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Our results suggest that, although these killer whales may consume a variety of fish species, they are highly specialized and dependent on this single salmonid species to an extent that it is a limiting factor in their population dynamics. Other ecologically specialized killer whale populations may be similarly constrained to a narrow range of prey species by culturally inherited foraging strategies, and thus are limited in their ability to adapt rapidly to changing prey availability.},

Telemetry data from five satellite-tagged whales (from three groups) and longline logbook entries (4,182 sets) from the Hawai‘i-based longline fisheries are used to assess the range of the population and potential interactions with longline gear. A switching state-space model with a 4-hour time step was used to assess the behavior of the tagged whales. Two of the groups remained within the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, while one group spent 87.5\% of its time in international waters to the east of the Hawaiian archipelago. Tagged whales came within 100 km of only 26 sets over the 184 days of tag data, with only two of the three groups coming within 50 km of a set. Only twice were whales (from only one group) known to approach closely enough to interact with gear, during two series of three deep-sets, with only one of the six sets recording no catch (indicating probable catch depredation). Movement towards the sets was most dramatic during the haul phase, in one case the tagged whales moved almost 100 km towards the gear in 7 hours. During one set in each of the two of the interactions, whale behavior changed to ‘area restricted search’ (indicative of foraging) during periods that overlapped with hauling of the gear. Overall, our results show that pelagic false killer whales spend a relatively small proportion of their time interacting with U.S. longline gear, and suggest that hauling gear may be an important cue initiating interactions.},

However, the ability to detect and therefore mitigate this issue is challenging for several reasons. Fishermen are unlikely to voluntarily report bycatch due to fear of penalization or apathy towards it. While fisheries observer programs are sometimes in place to record bycatch, many fisheries have no observers. In Hawaiian waters there are no observer programs in nearshore fisheries, yet interactions with fisheries are likely the greatest threat to the endangered main Hawaiian Islands insular population of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens). We assess spatiotemporal overlap between false killer whales and nearshore fisheries in Hawai‘i to identify fisheries and regions where interactions are most likely to occur. Interactions with fisheries was cited as the greatest threat to this population’s viability as a result of growing evidence over recent decades. We used false killer whale location data from 38 satellite tag deployments (2007–2018) and commercial fishery catch logs from a corresponding period to develop fishery overlap indices (FOIs) from a perspective that should reflect the experience of local fishermen. The area off Kona has the highest levels of fishing effort, but a low FOI, while high FOI values (up to several thousand times higher than Kona) were found off O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Maui, La¯na‘i and the north end of Hawai‘i. Our findings provide direction for where efforts should be focused to effectively monitor and mitigate bycatch for this endangered population of false killer whales.},

Scores were highest for scarred main Hawaiian Island (MHI) false killer whales, followed by pelagic and Northwestern Hawaiian Island (NWHI) individuals. Considering only whales for which the majority of evaluators scored scarring as consistent revealed signiﬁcant differences among populations in the percentage of individuals scarred; MHI: 7.5\%, pelagic: 0\%, NWHI: 0\%. Assessment by social cluster for the MHI population showed that 4.2\% of Cluster 1, 7.1\% of Cluster 2, and 12.8\% of Cluster 3 individuals had such scarring, although differences between clusters were not statistically signiﬁcant. There was a signiﬁcant sex bias; all sexed individuals (n = 7) with injuries consistent with ﬁsheries interactions were female.

	abstract = {Three populations of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) have been identified in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of the Hawaiian Archipelago (Hawaiian EEZ): 1) a main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) insular population, 2) a pelagic population, and 3) a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) population. Spatially-explicit stock boundaries are needed to assess and manage each population. New data, primarily satellite telemetry data, were collected that indicate the existing stock boundaries should be refined. These data were used by the False Killer Whale Stock Boundary Revision Working Group to establish revised, scientifically-defensible stock boundaries that appropriately reflect uncertainty and are robust to routine inputs from ongoing data collection. For each stock, several stock boundary options were identified by the Working Group and reviewed by the Pacific Scientific Review Group before the revised stock boundaries were finalized. The MHI insular stock boundary was changed from a uniform 140-km radius around the MHI to a minimum convex polygon bounded around a 72-km radius of the MHI, resulting in a boundary shape that reflects greater offshore use in the leeward portion of the MHI. While the wide-ranging pelagic stock continues to be assessed within the Hawaiian EEZ, the inner stock boundary was reduced from a 40-km to an 11-km radius around the MHI, a result of individuals occurring closer to shore than previously observed. The NWHI stock boundary largely remained the area of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument extended to include a 50-nmi radius around Kauaʻi, although 2 vertices were removed to widen the eastern portion, accounting for movement outside of the existing boundary. The following report summarizes the stock boundary revision process for the 3 false killer populations. Additionally, because the stock boundary placement affects the line-transect abundance estimates of the pelagic and NWHI stocks and the proration of false killer whale bycatch, the report also provides updated abundance estimates for pelagic and NWHI false killer whales and outlines a revised approach for bycatch proration.},

Sizes at birth, sexual maturation, and physical maturity all indicated that both sexes were 10\%–20\% larger in Japan than South Africa. Females reached sexual maturation at similar ages (8–10.5 yr) in both populations, and although sample sizes were too small to establish male ages at puberty precisely the ranges in Japan (10.5–18.5 yr) and South Africa (5.25–17.5 yr) were not inconsistent. The initial ovulation rate for females from South Africa was 65\% lower (and the apparent pregnancy rate 82\% lower) than those from Japan and there were fewer animals 2 yr old within the school, but the magnitude of these differences suggests that the stranded school’s reproductive performance was probably impaired. Collectively these comparisons and the literature indicate substantive size differences between false killer whales in different populations, although the patterns of growth appear similar. Firm conclusions about any geographical differences in reproduction require additional data.},

	abstract = {Monitoring bycatch in fisheries is essential for effective conservation and fisheries sustainability. False killer whales Pseudorca crassidens in Hawaiian waters are known to interact with both commercial and recreational fisheries, but limited observer coverage across Hawaiian fisheries obscures the ability to assess bycatch. We build upon previous work and assess occurrence of fisheries interactions through photographic evidence of dorsal fin and mouthline injuries for 3 false killer whale populations in Hawai‘i. Photographs of injuries on dorsal fins and mouthlines collected between 1999–2021 were scored for consistency with fishery interactions (‘not consistent’, ‘possibly consistent’, ‘consistent’). For individuals with both dorsal fin and mouthline photos available, the endangered main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) population had the highest rates of injuries consistent with fisheries interactions (28.7 \% of individuals), followed by the pelagic stock (11.7 \%), while no individuals from the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands population with both types of photos had fisheriesrelated injuries. Some individuals from the MHI population were documented with multiple fisheries-related injuries acquired on different occasions, indicating repeated interactions with fisheries. Individuals first began acquiring injuries consistent with fishery interactions at an estimated age of 2 yr. Females were more likely to have fisheries-related dorsal fin injuries than males, but rates of fisheries-related mouthline injuries were similar between the sexes. Injuries consistent with fisheries interactions were acquired throughout the study period, indicating that this is an ongoing issue, not a legacy of past fishery interactions. Our results suggest that efforts to reduce bycatch and begin monitoring of fisheries that overlap the range of the endangered MHI population are needed.},

	abstract = {False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) are large delphinids typically found in deep water far offshore. However, in the Hawaiian Archipelago, there are 2 resident island-associated populations of false killer whales, one in the waters around the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and one in the waters around the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI). We use mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences and genotypes from 16 nuclear DNA (nucDNA) microsatellite loci from 206 individuals to examine levels of differentiation among the 2 island-associated populations and offshore animals from the central and eastern North Pacific. Both mtDNA and nucDNA exhibit highly significant differentiation between populations, confirming limited gene flow in both sexes. The mtDNA haplotypes exhibit a strong pattern of phylogeographic concordance, with island-associated populations sharing 3 closely related haplotypes not found elsewhere in the Pacific. However, nucDNA data suggest that NWHI animals are at least as differentiated from MHI animals as they are from offshore animals. The patterns of differentiation revealed by the 2 marker types suggest that the island-associated false killer whale populations likely share a common colonization history, but have limited contemporary gene flow.},

	abstract = {Most mammals exhibit natal dispersal of one or both sexes, a behavior that likely evolved in part to reduce the chances of breeding with close relatives. When natal social group fidelity of both sexes has been documented, the risk of inbreeding is reduced by breeding among rather than within social groups. We investigated mating patterns in an endangered population of false killer whales Pseudorca crassidens from the main Hawaiian Islands (USA) using both genetic and photo-identification data. We tested the presence of the 2 most commonly observed inbreeding avoidance behaviors, i.e. natal dispersal and exogamy (mating occurring primarily among individuals from different social groups). Because not all mother−offspring pairs or individual ages were known prior to this study, we used re-sighting histories to determine plausible ranges of birth year for individuals, thereby limiting the pool of candidate parents and increasing analytical power. We identified 32 parent−offspring pairs, revealing strong natal social group fidelity for both sexes. Our results indicate that between 36 and 64\% of matings involved individuals from the same social group. Because the population declined from over 400 to around 150 individuals between the 1980s and early 2000s, the intra-group matings may be the result of reduced opportunities for inter-group mating since the decline. Prior to the decline, social groups may have been sufficiently large that selective pressure to develop inbreeding avoidance mechanisms was low, or the population may have evolved alternate inbreeding avoidance mechanisms such as kin recognition.},

Individual movements of up to 283 km were documented, with a large proportion of individuals moving among islands. Individuals were resighted up to 20.1 yr after ﬁrst being documented, showing long-term ﬁdelity to the islands.

This species has not been previously documented near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. During a 2010 large-vessel survey throughout the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) surrounding the Hawaiian Islands, false killer whales from 11 encounters were individually photo-identified, and photos were compared among encounters and with a catalog of false killer whales from the main Hawaiian Islands. Individuals from three of the encounters, all in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands within the eastern part of the Papahänaumokuäkea Marine National Monument, were the only ones documented that matched with false killer whales previously seen around the main Hawaiian Islands, and the matches were to individuals documented off Kaua‘i in 2008 that were of unknown population membership. Two individuals from one of these three 2010 encounters were instrumented with satellite tags attached to dorsal fins, and their movements were documented over 4.6 and 52 days. Movements of the tagged individuals ranged from French Frigate Shoals to Middle Bank (between Nïhoa and Ni‘ihau) and included shallow nearshore waters and deep waters to 147 km from land. Combined, the photo-identification and satellite-tagging results suggest that there is a second island-associated population of this species in Hawai‘i that primarily uses the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, with a range that overlaps with that of the main Hawaiian Islands insular population.},

In November 2010, the National Marine Fisheries Service proposed listing a small demographically isolated population of false killer whales Pseudorca crassidens in Hawai‘i as endangered but has not yet proposed designating critical habitat. We assessed the population’s range and heavily used habitat areas using data from 27 satellite tag deployments. Assessment of independence of individuals with temporally overlapping data indicated that data were from 22 ‘groups’. Further analyses were restricted to 1 individual per group. Tag data were available for periods of between 13 and 105 d (median = 40.5 d), with 8513 locations (93.4\% from July−January). Analyses of photo-identification data indicated that the population is divided into 3 large associations of individuals (social clusters), with tag data from 2 of these clusters. Ranges for these 2 clusters were similar, although one used significantly deeper waters, and their high-use areas differed. A minimum convex polygon range encompassing all locations was {\textasciitilde}82 800 km2, with individuals ranging from Ni‘ihau to Hawai‘i Island and up to 122 km offshore. Three high-use areas were identified: (1) off the north half of Hawai‘i Island, (2) north of Maui and Moloka‘i and (3) southwest of Lana‘i. Although this analysis provides information useful for decision-making concerning designation of critical habitat, there are likely other high-use areas that have not yet been identified due to seasonal limitations and availability of data from only 2 of the 3 main social clusters.},

Catch rates for apex predators such as blue shark (Prionace glauca), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga) tunas, shortbill spearfish (Tetrapturus angustirostris), and striped marlin (Tetrapturus audax) declined by 3\% to 9\% per year and catch rates for four midtrophic species, mahimahi (Coryphaena hippurus), sickle pomfret (Taractichthys steindachneri), escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), and snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens), increased by 6\% to 18\% per year. The mean trophic level of the catch for these 13 species declined 5\%, from 3.85 to 3.66. A shift in the ecosystem to an increase in midtrophic-level, fast-growing and short-lived species is indicated by the decline in apex predators in the catch (from 70\% to 40\%) and the increase in species with production to biomass values of 1.0 or larger in the catch (from 20\% to 40\%). This altered ecosystem may exhibit more temporal variation in response to climate variability.},

Recent evidence suggests the insular population may have declined precipitously over the last 20 yr, and one possible contributing factor is interactions with offshore longline fisheries or other hook and line fisheries. To assess movements and habitat use, satellite tags were remotely deployed on individuals in 3 groups from the insular population and one from the offshore population. Although tagged off the leeward side of the island of Hawai‘i, individuals from the insular population regularly moved to the windward sides of the islands. Some insular individuals moved extensively and rapidly among islands, while other individuals remained associated with the island of Hawai‘i for extended periods before moving among the other islands. Comparisons of distances between tagged individuals indicated that individuals within groups disassociated and re-associated over periods of days, occasionally moving more than 100 km apart before re-associating. The offshore individual, tagged 123.8 km offshore, approached to within 62 km of land, inshore of the longline fishery exclusion boundary. The 3 insular groups moved a maximum of 83, 87 and 96 km offshore, respectively, indicating that the distance from shore cannot be used as a strict boundary between the populations, and that individuals from the insular population may overlap with the longline fishery. When combined with photo-identification the results suggest that boundaries between these 2 stocks should be revised.},

                    Over recent years, a major breakthrough in marine animal tracking has occurred with the advent of Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    that provides highly accurate location data even for animals that only surface briefly such as sea turtles, marine mammals and penguins.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We assessed the accuracy of Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    locations using fixed trials of tags in which {\textgreater}45 000 locations were obtained. Procedures for determining the speed of travel and heading were developed by simulating tracks and then adding Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    location errors. The levels of detail achievable for speed and heading estimates were illustrated by using empirical Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    data for a green turtle (
                    Chelonia mydas

                    The accuracy of Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    locations varied as a function of the number of
                    GPS
                    satellites used in the location calculation. For example, when Fastloc‐
                    GPS
                    locations were calculated using 4
                    GPS
                    satellites, 50\% of locations were within 36 m and 95\% within 724 m of the true position. These values improved to 18 and 70 m, respectively, when 6 satellites were used. Simulations indicated that for animals travelling around 2·5 km h
                    −1
                    (e.g. turtles, penguins and seals) and depending on the number of satellites used in the location calculation, robust speed and heading estimates would usually be obtained for locations only 1–6 h apart.

	abstract = {The present study demonstrates that a distinct land-associated community of mesopelagic micronekton exists around the Hawaiian Islands. This “mesopelagic-boundary community” replaces the oceanic mesopelagic community over bottom depths of approx 400 to 700 m and includes about 14 species of fishes, 5 of shrimps and 4 of squids. Similar species of the mesopelagic micronekton have been reported in association with other landmasses at the boundary between the oceanic mesopelagic realm and upper continental or island slopes. These species may form a cosmopolitan “mesopelagic-boundary community” which shows regional differences in taxonomic composition, abundance and diversity. Boundary communities, with populations which are both tightly constrained geographically and relatively accessible to shore-based research programs, offer unique opportunities for studying biological processes of the mesopelagic realm and the interactions between neritic and oceanic populations. Data is presented from three midwater and two neuston sampling projects undertaken around the main Hawaiian Islands between 1987 and 1989; additional evidence from the literature is also discussed.},

	abstract = {Submarine canyons are important sources of habitat heterogeneity on the slopes of continents and islands, but the study of canyon ecology has been largely restricted to continental margins. Here we use visual and video surveys from 36 submersible dives to evaluate the role of canyons as abundance and diversity hotspots for megafauna in the Hawaiian Archipelago, an island chain embedded in an oligotrophic ocean. We surveyed megafauna in canyon and slope settings at depths of 350–1500 m along the margins of four islands: the low ‘islands’ of Nihoa and Maro Reef, and the high islands of Oahu and Moloka’i. Megafaunal communities in canyons differed signiﬁcantly from those in nearby slope habitats at all depths. Highly mobile ﬁshes and invertebrates were consistently more abundant in canyons than on nearby slopes at the same depth off all islands, suggesting that canyons may be important sources of larvae for surrounding habitats. In the few cases where megafaunal abundances were similar or higher on the slope, the differences were typically driven by higher slope abundance of sessile suspension feeders or animals with limited mobility, i.e. by organisms which are likely to have difﬁculty with high currents and sediment transport in canyons. Megafaunal species richness and diversity generally trended higher within canyons, especially for the highly mobile taxa. Canyons contained 41 megafaunal species never observed on the slope, and increased estimated regional species richness by 25–30 species, indicating that canyons enhanced beta and gamma (regional) biodiversity. An expected trend of greater enhancement of diversity and abundance in canyons on the margins of high versus low oceanic islands was not observed, although megafauna were generally more abundant in both canyon and slope habitats on the high islands (Oahu and Moloka’i). We conclude that submarine canyons on both low and high islands in the Hawaiian Archipelago may provide keystone structures, enhancing megafaunal abundance, providing source populations for the open slope, and enhancing local and regional species diversity.},

This simplification is only justified if interindividual niche variation is rare, weak, or has a trivial effect on ecological processes. This article reviews the incidence, degree, causes, and implications of individual-level niche variation to challenge these simplifications. Evidence for individual specialization is available for 93 species distributed across a broad range of taxonomic groups. Although few studies have quantified the degree to which individuals are specialized relative to their population, between-individual variation can sometimes comprise the majority of the population's niche width. The degree of individual specialization varies widely among species and among populations, reflecting a diverse array of physiological, behavioral, and ecological mechanisms that can generate intrapopulation variation. Finally, individual specialization has potentially important ecological, evolutionary, and conservation implications. Theory suggests that niche variation facilitates frequency-dependent interactions that can profoundly affect the population's stability, the amount of intraspecific competition, fitness-function shapes, and the population's capacity to diversify and speciate rapidly. Our collection of case studies suggests that individual specialization is a widespread but underappreciated phenomenon that poses many important but unanswered questions.},

Furthermore, myoglobin content is a key oxygen store in the muscle as it is many times higher in marine mammals than terrestrial mammals. Yet little consideration has been given to the effects of myoglobin content or body mass on cetacean dive capacity. To determine the importance of myoglobin content and body mass on cetacean diving performance, we measured myoglobin content of the longissimus dorsi for ten odontocete (toothed whales) and one mysticete (baleen whales) species ranging in body mass from 70 to 80 000 kg. The results showed that myoglobin content in cetaceans ranged from 1.81 to 5.78 g (100 g wet muscle)−1. Myoglobin content and body mass were both positively and significantly correlated to maximum dive duration in odontocetes; this differed from the relationship for mysticetes. Overall, the combined effects of body mass and myoglobin content accounts for 50\% of the variation in cetacean diving performance. While independent analysis of the odontocetes showed that body mass and myoglobin content accounts for 83\% of the variation in odontocete dive capacity.},

            In cooperative species, human-induced rapid environmental change may threaten cost–benefit tradeoffs of group behavioral strategies that evolved in past environments. Capacity for behavioral flexibility can increase population viability in novel environments. Whether the partitioning of individual responsibilities within social groups is fixed or flexible across populations is poorly understood, despite its relevance for predicting responses to global change at the population and species levels and designing successful conservation programs. We leveraged bio-logging data from two populations of fish-eating killer whales (Orcinus orca) to quantify patterns of fine-scale foraging movements and their relationships with demography. We reveal striking interpopulation differences in patterns of individual foraging behavior. Females from the endangered Southern Resident (SRKW) population captured less prey and spent less time pursuing prey than SRKW males or Northern Resident (NRKW) females, whereas NRKW females captured more prey than NRKW males. The presence of a calf (≤3 years) reduced the number of prey captured by adult females from both populations, but disproportionately so for SRKW. SRKW adult males with a living mother captured more prey than those whose mother had died, whereas the opposite was true for NRKW adult males. Across populations, males foraged in deeper areas than females, and SRKW captured prey deeper than NRKW. These population-level differences in patterns of individual foraging behavior challenge the existing paradigm that females are the disproportionate foragers in gregarious resident killer whales, and demonstrate considerable variation in the foraging strategies across populations of an apex marine predator experiencing different environmental stressors.},

	abstract = {Diverse and localized foraging behaviours have been reported in isolated populations of many animal species around the world. In Laguna, southern Brazil, a subset of resident bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) uses a foraging tactic involving cooperative interactions with local, beach-casting fishermen. We used individual photo-identification data to assess whether cooperative and non-cooperative dolphins were socially segregated. The social structure of the population was found to be a fission–fusion system with few non-random associations, typical for this species. However, association values were greater among cooperative dolphins than among non-cooperative dolphins or between dolphins from different foraging classes. Furthermore, the dolphin social network was divided into three modules, clustering individuals that shared or lacked the cooperative foraging tactic. Space-use patterns were not sufficient to explain this partitioning, indicating a behavioural factor. The segregation of dolphins using different foraging tactics could result from foraging behaviour driving social structure, while the closer association between dolphins engaged in the cooperation could facilitate the transmission and learning of this behavioural trait from conspecifics. This unique case of a dolphin–human interaction represents a valuable opportunity to explore hypotheses on the role of social learning in wild cetaceans.},

A total of 27 ADB tags were deployed on sperm whales in the central Gulf of California, Mexico, during spring 2007 and 2008, of which 10 were recovered for data download. Tracking durations of all tags ranged from 0 to 34.5 days (median = 2.3 days), and 0.6 to 26.6 days (median = 5.0 days) for recovered tags. Recovered tags recorded a median of 50.8 GPS-quality locations and 42.6 dives per day. Dive summary metrics were generated for archived dives and were subsequently classified into six categories using hierarchical cluster analysis. A mean of 77\% of archived dives per individual were one of four dive categories with median Maximum Dive Depth {\textgreater}290 m (V-shaped, Mid-water, Benthic, or Variable), likely associated with foraging. Median Maximum Dive Depth was {\textless}30 m for the other two categories (Short- and Long-duration shallow dives), likely representing socializing or resting behavior. Most tagged whales remained near the tagging area during the tracking period, but one moved north of Isla Tiburón, where it appeared to regularly dive to, and travel along the seafloor. Three whales were tagged on the same day in 2007 and subsequently traveled in close proximity ({\textless}1 km) for 2 days. During this period, the depth and timing of their dives were not coordinated, suggesting they were foraging on a vertically heterogeneous prey field. The multiweek dive records produced by ADB tags enabled us to generate a robust characterization of the diving behavior, activity budget, and individual variation for an important predator of the mesopelagos over temporal and spatial scales not previously possible.},

To examine acoustic communication in this species I analysed the relationship between click types and behaviour. The proportion of complex click types was greater in large groups, suggesting that these sounds have social significance. Clicks having 2 peaks in their time envelope and two frequency peaks were strongly associated with behaviours indicative of feeding. High pulse rate sounds, in which the repetition rate of ultrasonic clicks was audible as a “cry”, were most strongly associated with aerial behaviours. These data suggest that echo-location is not the sole function of Hector's dolphin clicks, and that echo-location and communication are likely to be closely linked. I hypothesize that dolphins may have the ability to gather information from the echoes of each other's sonar pulses. This may reduce the need for a large number of vocal signals, and may explain the apparent simplicity of the acoustic repertoires of some odontocetes.},

	abstract = {The Southern Resident killer whale population (Orcinus orca) was listed as endangered in 2005 and shows little sign of recovery. These fish eating whales feed primarily on endangered Chinook salmon. Population growth is constrained by low offspring production for the number of reproductive females in the population. Lack of prey, increased toxins and vessel disturbance have been listed as potential causes of the whale’s decline, but partitioning these pressures has been difficult. We validated and applied temporal measures of progesterone and testosterone metabolites to assess occurrence, stage and health of pregnancy from genotyped killer whale feces collected using detection dogs. Thyroid and glucocorticoid hormone metabolites were measured from these same samples to assess physiological stress. These methods enabled us to assess pregnancy occurrence and failure as well as how pregnancy success was temporally impacted by nutritional and other stressors, between 2008 and 2014. Up to 69\% of all detectable pregnancies were unsuccessful; of these, up to 33\% failed relatively late in gestation or immediately post-partum, when the cost is especially high. Low availability of Chinook salmon appears to be an important stressor among these fish-eating whales as well as a significant cause of late pregnancy failure, including unobserved perinatal loss. However, release of lipophilic toxicants during fat metabolism in the nutritionally deprived animals may also provide a contributor to these cumulative effects. Results point to the importance of promoting Chinook salmon recovery to enhance population growth of Southern Resident killer whales. The physiological measures used in this study can also be used to monitor the success of actions aimed at promoting adaptive management of this important apex predator to the Pacific Northwest.},

This study broadens the understanding of POPs in the endangered Southern Resident killer whale population by addressing modulation by prey availability and reproductive status, along with endocrine disrupting effects. A total of 140 killer whale scat samples collected from 54 unique whales across a 4 year sampling period (2010-2013) were analyzed for concentrations of POPs. Toxicant measures were linked to pod, age, and birth order in genotyped individuals, prey abundance using open-source test fishery data, and pregnancy status based on hormone indices from the same sample. Toxicant concentrations were highest and had the greatest potential for toxicity when prey abundance was the lowest. In addition, these toxicants were likely from endogenous lipid stores. Bioaccumulation of POPs increased with age, with the exception of presumed nulliparous females. The exceptional pattern may be explained by females experiencing unobserved neonatal loss. Transfer of POPs through mobilization of endogenous lipid stores during lactation was highest for first-borns with diminished transfer to subsequent calves. Contrary to expectation, POP concentrations did not demonstrate an associated disruption of thyroid hormone, although this association may have been masked by impacts of prey abundance on thyroid hormone concentrations. The noninvasive method for measuring POP concentrations in killer whales through scat employed in this study may improve toxicant monitoring in the marine environment and promote conservation efforts.},

We present evidence that this size selection is related to the optimal allocation of time spent searching for, and handling prey. A model relating search and handling time to energy return is constructed to determine the optimal breadth of diet. Prey are permitted to differ in size and relative abundance. All elements of the model are estimated from experiments with the bluegill feeding on populations constructed from size classes of Daphnia magna. Relative visibility of the different prey sizes markedly affects relative encounter rates or "effective" proportions. Effective proportions are determined empirically from feeding experiments and theoretically from reaction distance in order to correct for this bias. Search time is then manipulated by varying absolute abundance of prey.},

Vascular counter-current heat exchangers maintain body temperatures above ambient water temperature, thereby improving locomotor muscle efficiency, especially at burst speeds and when pursuing prey below the thermocline. Because tuna also occasionally swim rapidly in warm surface waters, it has been hypothesized that tuna thermoregulate to accommodate changing activity levels or ambient temperatures. But previous field experiments have been unable to demonstrate definitively short-latency, mammalian-type physiological thermoregulation. Here we show using telemetered data that free-ranging bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus) can rapidly alter whole-body thermal conductivity by two orders of magnitude. The heat exchangers are disengaged to allow rapid warming as the tuna ascend from cold water into warmer surface waters, and are reactivated to conserve heat when they return into the depths. Combining physiological and behavioural thermoregulation expands the foraging space of bigeye tuna into otherwise prohibitively cold, deep water.},

	abstract = {Spatial coherence between predators and prey has rarely been observed in pelagic marine ecosystems. We used measures of the environment, prey abundance, prey quality, and prey distribution to explain the observed distributions of three cooccurring predator species breeding on islands in the southeastern Bering Sea: black-legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), and northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus). Predictions of statistical models were tested using movement patterns obtained from satellite-tracked individual animals. With the most commonly used measures to quantify prey distributions - areal biomass, density, and numerical abundance - we were unable to find a spatial relationship between predators and their prey. We instead found that habitat use by all three predators was predicted most strongly by prey patch characteristics such as depth and local density within spatial aggregations. Additional prey patch characteristics and physical habitat also contributed significantly to characterizing predator patterns. Our results indicate that the smallscale prey patch characteristics are critical to how predators perceive the quality of their food supply and the mechanisms they use to exploit it, regardless of time of day, sampling year, or source colony. The three focal predator species had different constraints and employed different foraging strategies – a shallow diver that makes trips of moderate distance (kittiwakes), a deep diver that makes trip of short distances (murres), and a deep diver that makes extensive trips (fur seals). However, all three were similarly linked by patchiness of prey rather than by the distribution of overall biomass. This supports the hypothesis that patchiness may be critical for understanding predator-prey relationships in pelagic marine systems more generally.},

	abstract = {Food sharing has attracted much attention because of its apparently altruistic nature and its link to prosociality. However, food sharing has been mostly studied in a reproductive context, during courtship and parental care, where the fitness benefits are obvious. We still lack a clear understanding of the functions of food sharing outside any reproductive context and within social groups of same-aged peers. Previous studies suggest that cofeeding, the action to let another animal feed from the same monopolizable food source, may be used to build and strengthen bonds between individuals. This may be particularly crucial in social birds forming long-term associations between mates or siblings such as psittacids and corvids. Here, we investigated food sharing and affiliative behaviors such as allopreening in a psittacine species, namely in a group of captive juvenile cockatiels (Nymphicus hollandicus) consisting of five siblings and five unrelated birds. Our main objective was to study the developmental pattern of food sharing over time and its implication in social bonding depending on kinship, affiliation, and sex. Studying cockatiels in this context is providing many new information since most of the studies on food sharing in birds focused on corvids. We found that, contrary to jackdaws, cockatiels continued to share food with multiple individuals, although the frequency of cofeeding as well as the number of cofeeding partners decreased over time. Cockatiels shared more food with their siblings than with other conspecifics but they were not more likely to do cofeeding with birds of the opposite sex. We also found evidence that young cockatiels exchanged more food with those from whom they received food (reciprocity) and, to a lesser extent, allopreening (interchange), than from other cockatiels. Our findings suggest that in cockatiels, food sharing within social groups serves the formation (and maintenance) of affiliative bonds, especially between siblings, rather than pair bonds, but might additionally be explained by reciprocity, interchange, and harassment avoidance.},

The flippers are long, slender, and sickle shaped. A faint gray “saddle” patch may be visible behind the dorsal fin as well as a faint postorbital blaze. Calves are paler than adults. Pilot whales exhibit striking sexual dimorphism in size, similar to that observed in sperm whales and killer whales. Adult males are longer than females, develop a more pronounced melon, and have a much larger dorsal fin. The function of sexual dimorphism in pilot whales is unknown, although several have been hypothesized. The males' enlarged features may be used for display to other males or females or for increased agility when maneuvering for mate access or for herding females. Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales are difficult to distinguish at sea. The morphological differences between the two species are subtle: length of flippers, differences in skull shape, and number of teeth. Pilot whales are generally nomadic, but resident populations have been documented in a few locations such as coastal California and Hawaii. Common habitats are the continental shelf break, slope waters, and areas of high topographic relief. Seasonal inshore/offshore movements of pilot whales are related to the distribution of squid, their favorite prey. Pilot whales are highly social and are usually found in schools, or pods, averaging 20–90 individuals. Pilot whales are polygynous. Pilot whales share several features of life history with other large odontocetes: long life span, delayed maturity, different rates of maturation for males and females, seasonal mating, and the production of a single calf in multiyear intervals.},

	abstract = {For biological populations that form aggregations (or clusters) of individuals, cluster size is an important parameter in linetransect abundance estimation and should be accurately measured. Cluster size in cetaceans has traditionally been represented as the total number of individuals in a group, but group size may be underestimated if group members are spatially diffuse. Groups of false killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) can comprise numerous subgroups that are dispersed over tens of kilometers, leading to a spatial mismatch between a detected group and the theoretical framework of linetransect analysis. Three stocks of false killer whales are found within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone of the Hawaiian Islands (Hawaiian EEZ): an insular main Hawaiian Islands stock, a pelagic stock, and a Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) stock. A ship-based line-transect survey of the Hawaiian EEZ was conducted in the summer and fall of 2010, resulting in six systematic-effort visual sightings of pelagic (n = 5) and NWHI (n = 1) false killer whale groups. The maximum number and spatial extent of subgroups per sighting was 18 subgroups and 35 km, respectively. These sightings were combined with data from similar previous surveys and analyzed within the conventional line-transect estimation framework. The detection function, mean cluster size, and encounter rate were estimated separately to appropriately incorporate data collected using different methods. Unlike previous line-transect analyses of cetaceans, subgroups were treated as the analytical cluster instead of groups because subgroups better conform to the specifications of line-transect theory. Bootstrap values (n = 5,000) of the line-transect parameters were randomly combined to estimate the variance of stock-specific abundance estimates. Hawai’i pelagic and NWHI false killer whales were estimated to number 1,552 (CV = 0.66; 95\% CI = 479–5,030) and 552 (CV = 1.09; 95\% CI = 97–3,123) individuals, respectively. Subgroup structure is an important factor to consider in linetransect analyses of false killer whales and other species with complex grouping patterns.},

	abstract = {Three adult female beluga whales, Delphinapterus leucas, were captured during summer in the Canadian high Arctic and equipped with satellite-linked radio transmitters that measured and recorded ambient pressure every 20 s. Diving behaviour was divisible into three distinct categories: (1) near-surface, (2) "spike" dives to 20–150 m depth, and (3) prolonged, flat-bottomed dives to a maximum depth of 350 m. The duration of these prolonged dives was 9.3–13.7 min, but the upper bound is known to be underestimated. Average descent rates varied between dives in the range 1.43–2.20 m/s and ascent rates between 1.23 and 1.84 m/s. Within periods of 20 s duration, maximum descent and ascent rates were 2.55 and 2.35 m/s, respectively. After most prolonged dives the rate of ascent declined progressively as the surface was approached, particularly in the final 100 m. Such dives were usually to, or near to, the seabed and were probably for foraging. Up to 42\% of an animal's time could be spent at depths of 8 m or more.},

Deep foraging dives ({\textgreater}800 m) occurred at similar rates during the day and night for Blainville's beaked whales, and there were no significant diel differences in ascent rates, descent rates, or mean or maximum depths or durations for deep dives. Dive to mid-water depths (100–600 m) occurred significantly more often during the day (mean = 1.59 h−1) than at night (mean = 0.26 h−1). Series of progressively shallower “bounce” dives were only documented to follow the deep, long dives made during the day; at night whales spent more time in shallow ({\textless}100 m) depths. Significantly slower ascent rates than descent rates were found following deep foraging dives both during the day and night. Similar patterns were found for the Cuvier's beaked whales. Our results suggest that so-called “bounce” dives do not serve a physiological function, although the slow ascents may. This diel variation in behavior suggests that beaked whales may spend less time in surface waters during the day to avoid near-surface, visually oriented predators such as large sharks or killer whales (Orcinus orca).},

Measured muscle PN2 from the bottlenose dolphin after diving repeatedly to 100m (Tursiops truncatus [Ridgway and Howard, 1979, Science, 4423, 1182–1183]) was compared with predictions from the model. Lung collapse was modelled as a 100\% pulmonary shunt which yielded tissue PN2 similar to those reported for the dolphin. On the other hand, predicted muscle PN2 for an animal with a dive response, reducing cardiac output by 66\% from surface values (20.5 to 6.8l·min−1), also agreed well with observed values in the absence of lung collapse. In fact, modelling indicated that both cardiovascular adjustments and dive behaviour are important in reducing N2 uptake during diving and enhancing safe transfer of tissue and blood N2 back to the lung immediately before coming to the surface. In particular, diving bradycardia during the descent and bottom phase together with a reduced ascent rate and increase in heart rate reduced mixed venous PN2 upon return to the surface by as much as 45\%. This has important implications as small reductions in inert gas load (∼5\%) can substantially reduce decompression sickness (DCS) risk by as much as 50\% (Fahlman et al., 2001, J. Appl.

The sperm and killer whale followed one fishing vessel for \&gt;180 km and \&gt;300 km and repeatedly depredated when longlines were being retrieved over periods of 6 and 7 d, respectively. Their behaviours were also sometimes correlated with the depths and locations of deployed gear. They both dove significantly deeper and faster when depredating compared with when foraging naturally. The killer whale dove \&gt;750 m on five occasions while depredating (maximum: 1087 m), but these deep dives were always followed by long periods (3.9–4.6 h) of shallow (\&lt;100 m) diving. We hypothesize that energetically and physiologically costly dive behaviour while depredating is driven by intra- and inter-specific competition due to the limited availability of this abundant resource.},

Data were also collected on the depth of water where the birds were diving and the size of lesser sandeels. Ammodytes marinus, fed to young each year. On average, shags foraged in water 30 m deep; mean dive and recovery times were 62·0 ± 1·92 sec and 84·4 ± 5·02 sec. respectively. These times were much longer than those recorded in previous studies and also longer than those predicted from allometric relationships for dive and recovery times derived for cormorants. A large proportion ({\textgreater} 50\%)) of dives appeared to involve anaerobic metabolism. Dive and recovery times were examined in relation to water depth, time of day and position within the diving sequence (dive number). In each year. dive time was positively correlated with water depth: in 1987 dive number also had a negative effect. The relationship between recovery time and dive time was positively accelerated, suggesting that birds were diving anaerobically on longer dives. The percentage of the dive cycle spent underwater therefore decreased significantly as dive time and water depth increased. Average vertical rates of ascent and descent of shags were calculated to be between 1·46 1·87 m sec−1. Estimated prey capture rates were significantly higher in 1989 (average 6±8 fish dive−1) when adults were feeding their young on small, low energy value sandeels than the two previous years (averages 1·4 and 1·9 fish dive−1, respectively) when birds were feeding on larger, higher quality fish. We calculated that, on average, birds spent 8 10 sec (36 48\%) longer on the bottom at any given depth in 1989, which suggested that the higher prey capture ratcs were associated with an increase in duration of the bottom phase of the dive.},

	abstract = {1. Foraging behaviour of Antarctic fur seals rearing pups at Bird Island, South Georgia, was assessed using at-sea activity patterns measured by electronic time-depth recorders. Information was obtained for a total of 75 individuals and 191 foraging trips to sea over five reproductive seasons from 1988/89 to 1992/93; this included one season (1990/91) of low prey abundance. A method was developed to divide the diving record up into logical units or bouts which differed from past methods used for defining bouts of behaviour. 2. Foraging trips were significantly longer in 1990/91 than in the other years. There were significant differences between years in the proportion of time spent foraging when at sea and in the distribution of foraging through the day and night. These differences probably represent behavioural responses to changes in prey distribution and abundance and were reflected in the frequency of occurrence of different types of foraging behaviour. 3. Four types of foraging bout were recognized using a cluster analysis. Type I (short) bouts were of short duration (17 min) and occurred mainly during daytime and at dusk. They probably represented exploratory behaviour. Type II (long) bouts occurred mainly at night and were of long duration (80 min). They increased in frequency in 1990/91 when food was scarce and 61-73\% of time spent foraging was in these bouts. Type III (shallow) bouts occurred mainly at night, were of short duration (12 min) and represented feeding close to the surface, possibly in association with other, surface-feeding krill predators. Shallow bouts accounted for 8-14\% of time spent foraging. Type IV (deep) bouts were of medium duration (19 min) and represented feeding at greater depth (40-50 m) than other bout types. They were most abundant around dawn. 4. Mean dive duration during bouts exceeded the theoretical aerobic dive limit on {\textgreater} 30\% of occasions for short, long and deep bouts. There were positive correlations between mean dive duration and surface interval duration for most of these bout types in most years. This suggested that long dives incurred a cost in terms of the amount of time spent at the surface between dives. 5. The study demonstrated that female fur seals invest a significantly greater effort in foraging during periods of low prey abundance by both increasing the time spent foraging and by increasing activity during foraging. This could represent a 30-50\% increase in the costs of foraging during years of low food abundance.},

	abstract = {The analysis of telemetry data is common in animal ecological studies. While the collection of telemetry data for individual animals has improved dramatically, the methods to properly account for inherent uncertainties (e.g., measurement error, dependence, barriers to movement) have lagged behind. Still, many new statistical approaches have been developed to infer unknown quantities affecting animal movement or predict movement based on telemetry data. Hierarchical statistical models are useful to account for some of the aforementioned uncertainties, as well as provide population-level inference, but they often come with an increased computational burden. For certain types of statistical models, it is straightforward to provide inference if the latent true animal trajectory is known, but challenging otherwise. In these cases, approaches related to multiple imputation have been employed to account for the uncertainty associated with our knowledge of the latent trajectory. Despite the increasing use of imputation approaches for modeling animal movement, the general sensitivity and accuracy of these methods have not been explored in detail. We provide an introduction to animal movement modeling and describe how imputation approaches may be helpful for certain types of models. We also assess the performance of imputation approaches in two simulation studies. Our simulation studies suggests that inference for model parameters directly related to the location of an individual may be more accurate than inference for parameters associated with higher-order processes such as velocity or acceleration. Finally, we apply these methods to analyze a telemetry data set involving northern fur seals (Callorhinus ursinus) in the Bering Sea. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online.},

                  Natural populations that are rare, cryptic or inaccessible provide a monumental challenge to monitoring, as adequate data are extremely difficult to collect. Surveys often encompass only a small portion of a population's range due to difficult terrain or inclement weather, especially for populations with extensive ranges. Thus, to maximise encounters, sampling efforts may be largely opportunistic or biased to accessible areas. The resulting sparse and spatially biased data may be difficult to model, standardise across years and incorporate into an assessment or management framework. However, in many monitoring programs, there are usually multiple threads of data that, though each may have its own limitations, can be synthesised to reveal important ecological processes.
                
                
                  Here, we demonstrate a simple technique to incorporate two additional streams of data on the same population, telemetry and survey effort data, into capture‐recapture analyses to address spatiotemporal sampling bias using simulated data. Utilisation distributions (UDs) computed from telemetry data are overlaid with UDs of survey efforts, providing an ‘effort by animal space use’ overlap covariate for modelling detection in a Jolly–Seber open population model.
                
                
                  
                    Using simulated data, we found that our method resulted in more accurate and precise estimates of abundance than traditional capture‐recapture models. We then applied this method to a 16 year photo‐identification capture‐recapture dataset (
                    n
                     = 143 individuals) along with telemetry data (

	abstract = {Background Beaked whale response to Navy sonars is a global concern due to past stranding events coinciding with training activity. Often, controlled exposure experiments involve tagging cetaceans with short-term, highresolution tags and exposing them to relatively short, single bouts of mid-frequency active sonar (MFAS). In contrast, longer-duration satellite-transmitting tags deployed around Navy ranges enables behavioral response studies of animals exposed to realistic Navy training activities over extended periods and spatial scales, with multiple exposures to different sources.
Methods To study their behavior relative to extended periods of realistic Navy training, satellite-transmitting tags were deployed on four Blainville’s beaked whales (Mesoplodon densirostris) on the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) off Kaua‘i. Tags were deployed in 3 years, ahead of Submarine Command Courses (SCCs) with multiple sources of MFAS. Dive behavior of two tagged together were compared to acoustically detected group vocal periods (GVPs) on the range. Pre-exposure dive behavior metrics were compared to those during exposures. Horizontal movement behavior metrics were analyzed using Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric and Tukey–Kramer multiple comparison tests.
Results Two whales remained together and highly synchronized in their dive and movement behavior until the onset of MFAS, at which time they appeared to separate. Twenty-three deep foraging dives were matched to GVPs, including three during MFAS. Of the dive behavior metrics, only the depth of one intermediate dive during an exposure was outside the 95th percentile of baseline behavior. Three of the four movement behavior metrics (75\%) were atypical relative to baseline for at least one whale across SCC phases, but response varied by individual. However, throughout the SCCs, the whales remained within tens of kilometers of PMRF, near areas used before and after SCCs.
Conclusions These data demonstrate some apparent short-term changes to dive behavior and horizontal movement in response to MFAS. However, these beaked whales did not demonstrate sustained avoidance responses, remaining in the area west of the range during MFAS and in two cases returning to the range after the SCC. Additional tagging and photo-identification studies are critical to understand Blainville’s beaked whale habitat use and residency and to assess the potential impact of repeated exposures to MFAS.},

Odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins and porpoises) are of particular concern because they rely on learned, specialized foraging tactics in habitats highly affected by human activities. We present a global inventory of odontocete foraging tactics to evaluate their cultural underpinnings, vulnerability to human-induced threats and how this knowledge can inform safeguards. Our synthesis reveals a diverse repertoire—190 cases of 36 foraging tactics in 21 species—but highlights that linkages between culture and anthropogenic impacts are generally obscured by a dearth of data on individual identity, social associations and behavioural diffusion. By identifying global patterns, knowledge gaps and common threats to specialized foraging, our review can guide long-term research towards understanding their ecological and evolutionary drivers. This crucial first step towards designing policies that mitigate human impacts on marine habitats may ultimately protect the diverse odontocete behavioural repertoires that contribute to their survival.

	abstract = {Here we update U.S. West Coast Biologically Important Areas (BIAs) that were published in 2015 using new data and approaches. Additionally, BIAs were delineated for two species that were not delineated in the 2015 BIAs: fin whales and Southern Resident killer whales (SRKW). While harbor porpoise BIAs remained the same, substantial changes were made for other species including identifying both larger overall areas (parent BIAs) and smaller core areas (child BIAs). For blue, fin, and humpback whales we identified, delineated, and scored BIAs using the overlap between the distribution and relative density from three data sources, leveraging the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches: 1) habitat density models based on Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) line-transect data from systematic ship surveys conducted through 2018, 2) satellite tag data from deployments conducted by three research groups, and 3) sightings of feeding behavior from non-systematic effort mostly associated with small-boat surveys for photo-identification conducted by Cascadia Research Collective. While the previous BIAs were based solely on a more subjective assignment from only the small boat sightings, here we incorporate the other two data sources and use a more rigorous, quantitative approach to identify higher density areas and integrate the data types. This resulted in larger, better-supported, objective BIAs compared to the previous effort. Our methods are also more consistent with the delineation of BIAs in other regions. For SRKWs, the parent BIA was based on a modification of the Critical Habitat boundaries defined by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) Canada; a core BIA highlighting areas of intensified use was identified using both NOAA’s Critical Habitat and kernel density analyses of satellite tag data. Gray whale BIAs were re-evaluated for the migratory corridor of Eastern North Pacific gray whales, for Pacific Coast Feeding Group feeding areas, and for gray whales that feed regularly in Puget Sound.},
