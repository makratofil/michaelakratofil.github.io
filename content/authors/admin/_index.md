## About Me

I'm a [NSF GRFP Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) in the [Lab for Animal Behavioral Interaction Research in the Ocean (LABIRINTO)](https://thelabirinto.com/) at Oregon State University's [Marine Mammal Institute](https://mmi.oregonstate.edu/). I'm also a Research Biologist at [Cascadia Research Collective](https://www.cascadiaresearch.org/), a non-profit organization conducting research on marine mammal populations off the US West Coast and Hawaiian Islands, and collaborate with CRC on my dissertation research.

I'm broadly interested in applied ecological research, but have a particular interest in the movement ecology of socially complex species. Through my current and future research, I aim to use quantitative techniques to better understand how both the physical and social environments shape animal movement, and what implications these have for individual fitness, population persistence, and management efforts.

Much of my work has naturally involved analyzing telemetry data, primarily for research initiatives on Hawaiian odontocetes, although I'm involved in a number of different studies concerning cetacean population structure, ecology, and management. Thus far my research has entertained a variety of conservation themes, including ecotoxicology, fisheries bycatch, mid-frequency sonar exposure-response, and species-habitat modeling.
